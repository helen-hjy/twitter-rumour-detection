How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales These droplets land on objects	and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China.<EOS>It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging<EOS>from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.<EOS>What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019<EOS>What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread. https://t.co/ItmFmb8ghD<EOS>	nonrumour

12.  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone!  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.	2. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019<EOS>3. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.<EOS>4. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>8. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?<EOS>10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.<EOS>11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<EOS>13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.<EOS>13.(A) However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.  You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:<EOS>13.(B) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<EOS>13. (C) Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.<EOS>13. (C)...

The Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions: Updated March 2, 2020  What is a coronavirus? It is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can	and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to lung lesions and pneumonia. How contagious is the virus? It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces.<EOS>The pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.Where has the virus spread? The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 89,700 in<EOS>at least 67 countries and more than 3,000 have died. The spread has slowed in China, but is picking up speed in Europe and the United States. What symptoms should I look out for? Symptoms, which can take between two to 14 days to appear, include fever, cough<EOS>and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, but people may be able to pass on the virus even before they develop symptoms. How do I keep myself and others safe? Washing your hands frequently is the most<EOS>the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you‚Äôre sick and avoiding touching your face. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak? Keep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand.<EOS>Have a support system in place for elderly family members. What if I‚Äôm traveling? The C.D.C. has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea, China, Italy and Iran. And the agency has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan.<EOS>How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine? Several drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. A vaccine to stop the spread is still at least a year away.<EOS>	nonrumour

MISCONCEPTIONS  ¬†1.) COVID-19 is just like the flu/another strain of the flu.  ¬†2.) COVID-19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu.  ¬†3.) Younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.	Of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of COVID-19 in this coming fall. (4) The reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infect<EOS>all individuals, young and old and typically more virulent as well.(5) Which brings me to point #4.¬† ¬†4.) The actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.<EOS>The prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in COVID-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of COVID-19 in the fall able to severely<EOS>affect all individuals as the more COVID-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) The stopping of the spread of COVID-19 now is CRUCIAL to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,<EOS>immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. It should also be noted that not extending the course of the COVID-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace as<EOS>a result of financial need leading to increased spread. (7,8)  I would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic, and I applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases.<EOS>I am, however, passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases. I highly encourage everyone of you to do your research, educate yourself on how you can best help yourself, your family,<EOS>and your community. The efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort. The actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come.<EOS>I urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself.¬†  REFERENCES 1)https://t.co/i6KAsMaWuP 2)https://t.co/f7nqOY0FiP 3) https://t.co/UH8loCRhkD 4) https://t.co/ESDMPsmgkw 5)https://t.co/QBAWYhhGAb<EOS>6) https://t.co/lDIesSygs5 7)https://t.co/6iFECL5fgC 8)https://t.co/Lg0g6f9c9b<EOS>	rumour

Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus. There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.	By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. https://t.co/H8M0OgibEU<EOS>The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.<EOS>To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. https://t.co/kSdfGWv5GI<EOS>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus? No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<EOS>Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. https://t.co/sJhxDjdhrA<EOS>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG<EOS>How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn<EOS>Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus? No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.<EOS>Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.<EOS>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.<EOS>Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP<EOS>Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.<EOS>Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

I. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	D. How can I protect myself  You can protect yourself by: -  Washing your hands with soap and running water frequently : before and after eating, after using toilet, touching animals or animal waste - Covering mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing<EOS>- Avoiding close contact with anyone who shows symptoms. - Seek medical care if you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing. #Trending #CoronavirusOutbreak<EOS>- Have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care - Do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick<EOS>- Are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected CoronaVirus Infection<EOS>G. How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask  ‚Ä¢Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. ‚Ä¢Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.<EOS>‚Ä¢Avoid touching the mask while using it; ‚Ä¢Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use is advised.<EOS>H. Does the new coronavirus affect older people  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.<EOS>J. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.<EOS>The goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.<EOS>	nonrumour

If you have a series of lockdowns followed by a series of new peaks - what is the point of lockdown?	for countries like Bulgaria that locked down incredibly early, prevented much of a spread at all and then reopened, the renewed spike puts them in an awkward position. https://t.co/QzvoOWerEu<EOS>@AHart1974 @econhedge Unfortunately untrue: if you do herd immunity it‚Äôs going to get out of control within an instant which will overwhelm the ICU units especially in a country like America which only has a healthcare system for the rich.

Can eating garlic help prevent the virus?  Garlic does have antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from outbreak that garlic has protected people from the virus.  Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?	common questions about covid-19 https://t.co/4lsWi6ImPq<EOS>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?  UV lamps shouldn‚Äôt be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause cell deaths.   How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?<EOS>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever because of infection with the virus.  They can‚Äôt detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. Due to it taking between 2-10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.<EOS>Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?  No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the virus?  No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the virus.  The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.<EOS>Can rinsing your nose with saline help prevent the virus?  No. There is no evidence that rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from the virus.   There is some limited evidence that rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.<EOS>People of all ages can be infected by covid-19. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.   Are antibiotics effective in treating the virus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.<EOS>All sources are from the world health organisation website.

That's what's happening in AZ right now before your eyes.  It would be GREAT if herd if immunity was real and easy to achieve.

Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.	WHAT ARE CORONAVIRUSES, COVID-19 AND HOW ARE THEY RELATED TO SARS?  What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.<EOS>In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).<EOS>The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.  What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.

I'm not a medical professional but I would want to share I little I have learnt about #Coronavirus and #COVID19  What is a Coronavirus? A coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person.	There are 3 currently identified #coronaviruses 1.The MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.  2. The SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China 3. The #COVID19 or the #WuhanCoronovirus<EOS>COVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms may include:  1.fever  Anyone with a measured temperature of at least 100.4 ¬∞F [38 ¬∞C])  2. Cough 3. Shortness of breath<EOS>There is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Symptoms of a coronavirus usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor to prescribe pain or fever medication. As with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest.<EOS>	nonrumour

HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?  ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.   üí¶ The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.	ü•Ñ These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   üëà Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   ‚ÜîÔ∏è People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who<EOS>coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    #WHOWhatsapp<EOS>	nonrumour

Part 3  What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.  #FREDIBOAT	Part 5  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 6  How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 7  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19<EOS>Part 8  who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.¬†¬†¬†¬†  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.¬† See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?‚Äù<EOS>Part 10  Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However,  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 11  many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.¬†  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 12  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.¬†¬†¬†¬† #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 13  Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 14   route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 15  Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 16  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 19  droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 20  surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<EOS>Part 22  cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 23  have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 24  Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 25  You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.  **********  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading  Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 26  everyone)  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 27  to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 28 Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 29  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?  The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around<EOS>Part 30  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to<EOS>Part 31  comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 32  China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.	What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. https://t.co/LM6wHFpLd9<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with ++<EOS>COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?<EOS>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.<EOS>This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<EOS>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<EOS>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why?<EOS>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why?<EOS>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why?<EOS>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.<EOS>Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.<EOS>This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have++<EOS>diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

How does Covid-19 spread? At the moment, we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets. Droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing.	As of today,¬†169,906¬†Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in¬†6,644¬†fatalities worldwide. After its discovery last December, in Wuhan, China, the virus started to spread around the world, causing panic.<EOS>How do the seven human coronaviruses differ?  The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.<EOS>How do viruses work? A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. It enters the cell through binding with receptors and ‚Äúreprogrammes it‚Äù to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.<EOS>The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.<EOS>There are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. But this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty.<EOS>How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars, Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold? We cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.<EOS>Also, with Covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.  The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since Covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.<EOS>It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for Sars-Cov-2 is higher.<EOS>Although compared to Sars (9.6 per cent) and Mers (34.4 per cent), Covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.<EOS>Can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus? For some respiratory viruses this does happen. Not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. In this case, it is still premature to say.<EOS>	nonrumour

When this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide, it made me fear for my life. But now? It infected more than a hundred thousands of people, millions of people to be exact. What is ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù anyway? It is a crisis that we all should take seriously. https://t.co/NHfu1zqT8M	This pandemic, I became productive. I learned how to decipher codes, I get to watch a lot of animes and read many books. I am happy because I get to spend more time with my family like, watching movies, eating together and talked and talked about everything.<EOS>This pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask. Some families doesn‚Äôt have a proper home, some doesn‚Äôt have the stable job to provide the need for their family, and some doesn‚Äôt have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic.<EOS>What about them? There are people that are hoarding the necessities, to what? To benefit you from preventing the virus? To re-sell it at a higher price? These people didn‚Äôt even think about the people who doesn‚Äôt have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family. https://t.co/T0U9uPAtMW<EOS>To be honest, I got mad at them. During this pandemic, I also realized how bad our government is. The president didn‚Äôt even bother to tell us the plan at an early time, instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules. I mean????? https://t.co/bIn59b1taG<EOS>The people not obeying the rules are hungry, they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed. https://t.co/u0bh2k7rfv<EOS>I also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are, if you have a position at the government and if you are rich, you can wander freely everywhere, spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you don‚Äôt deserve. https://t.co/rATVH3UisK<EOS>This pandemic made me aware of the issues of what‚Äôs really happening. It angers me a lot, to be honest because if you don‚Äôt have the privilege, you are going to be ignored like a pest. That‚Äôs how dirty the government works.<EOS>We already have the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia with minimal testing. Without testing, we‚Äôre acting blind &amp; exposing the vulnerable‚Äî old, poor, and the jobless. I think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown. https://t.co/iKhER5Gf8S<EOS>We should all cooperate during this lockdown. The government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside. We can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to God and the frontliners. https://t.co/Mfq7mH4RoG<EOS>We also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners, not only they are giving their absolute best, but they are staking their lives as well. https://t.co/WkgIcdU6Ac<EOS>REINE ELYSSA G.

@FatEmperor @meredithpharmd @IMWHorvitz @guido_vogel @KPMarie48 @whsource @frumioj @DoctorTro What is it for normal flu? Guessing it's pretty high. Given the extremely low average mortality rate for COVID-19 I'd expect the NNT to be over 10,000, maybe much higher once herd immunity is reached worldwide. Residual panic will no doubt help with sales.	@meredithpharmd @FatEmperor @DaleWil39870290 @guido_vogel @KPMarie48 @whsource @frumioj @DoctorTro Agree Meredith. But when herd immunity takes over, it will have fewer hosts. My belief is that immunity from a real infection is greater than that achieved from a vaccine. COVID is so contagious that herd will occur prior to a vaccine.<EOS>	nonrumour
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  √ò Cough √ò Fever √ò Breathing difficulties Unwell people who have recently travelled from any country with ongoing transmission of COVID-19 ü¶†should immediately contact NCDC on 07032864444 or 0800-97000010 (toll-free).	Am I at risk of catching COVID-19 from a package or products that arrive from countries with a confirmed case(s)?  Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods or packages countries with ongoing transmission.<EOS>Till date, there is no known case of COVID-19 in Nigeria associated with imported goods.<EOS>Should I stop my children from going to school?  No. The current situation in the country does not warrant a shutdown of daily activities. During a pandemic, various measures are instituted depending on how serious the illness is and how easily it is spread from person to person.<EOS>At the moment, there is one confirmed case in Nigeria. Therefore, measures such as school closure or closure of large gatherings, are not required. Persons with persistent cough or sneezing should stay home or keep a social distance, but not mix in a crowd.<EOS>Is there anything a person can do to avoid becoming infected?  To reduce the risk of infection or spread of COVID-19, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following hand and respiratory hygiene measures:<EOS>‚Ä¢ Wash your hands regularly with soap under running water and use hand sanitisers frequently<EOS>‚Ä¢ Cover your mouth and nose properly with tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing and immediately dispose of the tissue in a covered waste bin. After this, wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser<EOS>‚Ä¢ You may also cough into your elbow if disposable tissue is not available. You are strongly advised not to re-use handkerchiefs<EOS>‚Ä¢ If you become sick while travelling, you should avoid close contact with other people while you are symptomatic and cover your mouth and nose with a face mask<EOS>‚Ä¢ Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing<EOS>‚Ä¢ Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history<EOS>What can businesses do to protect their staff?  Businesses have an important role to play in protecting their employees. Employers are advised to circulate NCDC‚Äôs public health advisory on COVID-19 to all staff.<EOS>Encourage sick employees to stay at home if they are unwell. Ensure routine cleaning of high contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones.<EOS>If staff have travelled to any of the countries with ongoing transmission, they should be advised to self-isolate for 14 days.  *Countries with ongoing transmission as at February 28, 2020: China, Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan  End.<EOS>Frequently Asked Questions on CoronaVirus #COVID19 ü¶† from @NCDCgov   Please Share. https://t.co/De2d9TBETZ<EOS>	nonrumour

Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19? No. Antibiotics dont work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment	Protection measures for everyone.   * Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.  * Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<EOS>* Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.  * Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.<EOS>*Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once.<EOS>The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  Smoking Wearing multiple masks Taking antibiotics.    Culled from W.H.O website<EOS>Who is at risk of developing severe illness? COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others.<EOS>	nonrumour

https://t.co/jCJpa9L9NM What is Haseltine talking about? This is simply wrong. The common cold coronaviruses confer immunity for several months to several years, about 2 years on average. Seems to also completely confuse the concept of herd immunity with just immunity. WTF	Difficult to see this as anything but alarmism and sensationalism. We are ~7 months into this pandemic with all eyes on this virus, and there is still not a single example of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection reported.<EOS>	nonrumour

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.   1/3	Let¬¥s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let¬¥s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization. #CovidfreeApril #CovidfreePhilippines #CovidfreeWorld<EOS>What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.<EOS>What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.   2/3<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  3/3<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   1/3<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   2/3<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  3/3<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.   1/2<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    2/2<EOS>	nonrumour

THREAD on #COVID19 spread &amp; testing.  How does COVID-19 spread?  It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. Close contact, which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w/a sick individual, increases your risk of catching it. (1/12)   #COVID19US https://t.co/phLi8f97Dw	‚Ä¶ individuals with severe illness from COVID-19 may need hospital care, which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease‚Ä¶ (5/12)  #COVID19US<EOS>‚Ä¶ Whether you are positive or negative, we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others‚Ä¶ (6/12)  #COVID19US<EOS>‚Ä¶ If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test OR for 72 hours after your symptoms end, whichever is LONGER‚Ä¶ (7/12)  #COVID19US<EOS>‚Ä¶ This is different from flu, which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive. No specific treatment for COVID-19 = no different care after a positive test result. (8/12)  #COVID19US<EOS>Who gets tested? How?  Anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider. If the provider decides a test is needed, they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab‚Ä¶ (9/12)  #COVID19US<EOS>‚Ä¶ Working with a provider is very important‚Äîa cough and fever can have many causes, so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment‚Ä¶ (10/12)  #COVID19US<EOS>‚Ä¶ There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, so if your symptoms are from some other cause, it‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre working with a provider who can help you get well.

@SayingHello2U From WHO info page. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS? No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.	@sphacelate In what way? This one spreads far quicker, and it has already reached far more people than SARS did. Also, it takes 4 to 5 weeks to die, and so nobody knows the fatality death rate yet.<EOS>@sphacelate Right off, his data is wrong. It started early December - not the 29th December. Also the World Health Orgaization says it's worse than SARS.<EOS>@sphacelate If a disease only spreads to a thousand people, and it kills 10%, that is only a 100 dead. If a disease spreads to 5 million people, and it kills 3% (current fatality rate), it kills 30,000 people. It is the ease of spreading that makes it more dangerous.<EOS>@SayingHello2U I would still put that on par with a bad flu bug, most people don't die from it and that fatality percentage can change based on how it's reacted to and where geographically you look.  With proper prevention this won't result in a pandemic.<EOS>@sphacelate Yes, I know that. But it takes approximately 5 weeks from the date of manifestation of the illness (not the incubation period) to die. Most people have not recovered yet. So the death rate might be a lot higher. The fact that SARS didn't spread easily means it was less dangerous.<EOS>	nonrumour

For asking that question, @Juliajoy, you will be told that you are saying Covid-19 is 'just like the flu'. It will be a lie.

Q: Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV)? A: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The 2019-nC0V is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should  not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. @WHO https://t.co/2cJBBxKaaZ	Suspected: 17988 Confirmed: 11821 Deaths: 259 Recovered: 245  #coronavirus https://t.co/dCEglgh7Nr<EOS>The Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan, China, has now spread to 27 countries and territories worldwide, with 11,948 confirmed cases and 259 deaths as of February 1, 2020, 00:40 GMT. #coronarovirus #worldometers<EOS>Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the US have reported cases in patients who didn't personally visit China, but contracted the virus from someone else who had visited Wuhan, China. These cases of human to human transmission are the most worrisone, according to the WHO. #coronavirus<EOS>Q: Does the new #coronavirus (2019-nC0V) affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? A: People of all ages can be infected by the virus. Older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus https://t.co/oVq4ysz1fo<EOS>Q: Can pets at home spread the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV)? A: At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs, cats can be infected with the virus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets @WHO https://t.co/9sDqUAkEJk<EOS>Q: Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?

WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range of partners. @WHO https://t.co/5G7sdyWzT3<EOS>Q: Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against #2019nCoV? A: No. Vaccines against pneumonia do not provide protection against 2019-nCoV. The virus is new and different. It needs its own vaccine.  #KnowTheFacts @WHO https://t.co/BQFXE6Dw2m<EOS>Q: Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China? A: Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting #2019nCoV.

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. https://t.co/OiusUGcg8F<EOS>	nonrumour

J. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus ?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.	E. Protecting others from getting sick   You can protect others from getting sick taking the following precautions  - When coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with elbow or tissue - Throw the tissue in a bin immediately after use<EOS>- Clean hands with soap after coughing or sneezing  - Avoid close contact when you are experiencing cough and fever - Avoid spitting in public - Seek medical care if your loved one have fever, cough or difficulty breathing.<EOS>- Have cough, fever and difficulty breathing and seek medical care - Do not have these symptoms you do not have to wear a mask as there is no evidence that they protect people who are not sick<EOS>- Are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected CoronaVirus Infection<EOS>G.

Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus ?  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized support.<EOS>The goal is to be safe, play safe and be safe.<EOS>	nonrumour

MYTH-12: DOES THE NEW CORONAVIRUS AFFECT OLDER PEOPLE, OR ARE YOUNGER PEOPLE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  14/n	MYTH-07: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THERMAL SCANNERS IN DETECTING PEOPLE INFECTED WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.  10/n<EOS>MYTH-08: CAN SPRAYING ALCOHOL OR CHLORINE ALL OVER YOUR BODY KILL THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes.   11/n<EOS>MYTH-09: DO VACCINES AGAINST PNEUMONIA PROTECT YOU AGAINST THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.  12/n<EOS>MYTH-10: CAN REGULARLY RINSING YOUR NOSE WITH SALINE HELP PREVENT INFECTION WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.   13/n<EOS>MYTH-13: ARE ANTIBIOTICS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.  15/n<EOS>MYTH-14: ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC MEDICINES TO PREVENT OR TREAT THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  Source: @WHO  16/n<EOS>	nonrumour

What is #herdimmunity threshold for #COVID19? A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp; huge consequences for long term impact.   New paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially (spoiler: we still don't know value). Thread. https://t.co/Sgrg1yrlOq	Human populations are NOT WELL-MIXED &amp; HOMOGENOUS, so calcs give likely upper bound.  Q: So what is herd immunity threshold (HIT) for real pops? A: *Usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.<EOS>Background: If we know reproductive number R0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (HIT) for WELL-MIXED HOMOGENOUS population is simply 1-1/R0.  (Note R0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).<EOS>1) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering HIT. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread). 2) If some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT.  3)If some people don't transmit that also reduces HIT.<EOS>Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.<EOS>However, see paper by @mgmgomes1 that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than Science paper cited above. Fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects HIT, f, for R0=3; so HIT=0.66, f = 0.94. https://t.co/P5n0c1tXK1 https://t.co/j44vxDQ9Bq<EOS>Science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces HIT. It considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.<EOS>The strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. The citation they give is NOT a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ Matlab files. It's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there. @sbfnk can probably provide best ones<EOS>The take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. NOT well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential "activity" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce HIT for R0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43. https://t.co/z5XPjIET2e<EOS>The conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value. https://t.co/yYGDmGEdL5<EOS>What I find puzzling is that this paper is in Science. It's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. It isn't as general as @mgmgomes1 paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. Many older papers say same thing.<EOS>@mgmgomes1 paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on HIT, f based on data (colored lines in figure). https://t.co/OuxCx8yw5Q<EOS>In idealized population, early vaccination to HIT will prevent outbreak b/c Rt=R0*S/N so Rt&lt;1. However, an epidemic will overshoot HIT &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*R0)).  For R0=2.5 (reasonable for COVID19 in some pops), HIT=0.6, and f = 0.89.<EOS>These simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led @mlipsitch to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. Most articles cited the 70%  *BUT* @mlipsitch knew that... https://t.co/8dFlzOz4t9<EOS>I'd like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. But ...<EOS>Serological data from NYC suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or R0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20% - I added horiz dashed line). https://t.co/Mwn4USQ6nk https://t.co/78ozBGuYPo<EOS>Together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;1-1/R0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1-exp(-(f*R0)), but by how much is still unknown. Ugh.  @mlipsitch smartly gave a wide range 40-70% (20-60% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions. https://t.co/S5criybrMz<EOS>Unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for HIT for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does R0). The take home message is want to get to HIT by vaccination NOT infection.<EOS>@DiseaseEcology Are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from HIV or STIs with highly stratified risk groups)?  #COVID19<EOS>@AndrewALover Yes. See link at end to interview with @mlipsitch that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.<EOS>@DiseaseEcology @vcolizza did some work on this in 2007 or so also when I recall correctly: ‚Äú"A programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available."<EOS>@guido_leenders @vcolizza This is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial).<EOS>@DiseaseEcology @nataliexdean Do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts?<EOS>@whenigodeaf @nataliexdean Not yet, sadly!<EOS>@DiseaseEcology @nataliexdean without reading: the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading.<EOS>@DiseaseEcology @nataliexdean @threadreaderapp unroll please<EOS>@IngelisaKeeling Salam, please find the unroll here: @DiseaseEcology: What is #herdimmunity threshold for #COVID19?

Q. How long does the virus survive on surfaces? A. [1/2] Preliminary studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days but this may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).	Q. Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported? A. Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods &amp; the risk of catching the virus from a package that has been exposed to different conditions &amp; temperature is very low.<EOS>[2/2] If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.

Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn<EOS>Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus? No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.<EOS>Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.<EOS>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.<EOS>Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP<EOS>Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.<EOS>Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

@ColinAitchison When can we expect the full results from this survey so we can interpret comprehensive results with proper context? Or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day?	Lot's of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy, but our survey of Albertans would disagree.   Students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education. The percentages were pretty consistent as well.  Education choice benefits all. #abed https://t.co/ozppEImPJ8<EOS>@ColinAitchison This is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted.<EOS>@karliwithakay @ColinAitchison There is a wealth of research evidence that shows, for example, the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

The 2019-nC0V is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should  not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. @WHO https://t.co/2cJBBxKaaZ	Chinese tech companies have donated nearly 3 billion yuan ($432.5 million) to help fight the outbreak of novel #coronavirus-related pneumonia in Central China's Hubei province. https://t.co/IeYCCUEzJT<EOS>	nonrumour
Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus? No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth busters  Issa threadüëáüëáüëá<EOS>Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China? Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. https://t.co/h8kjFn9QfU<EOS>Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.<EOS>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/HN7yBWhYlQ<EOS>Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/X63kY0i8o3<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX<EOS>Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body? No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%<EOS>ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform. However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to<EOS>be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†  WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat<EOS>symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. https://t.co/KlV6s5lbvH<EOS>	nonrumour

First, what is a coronavirus?  Ulmer: This particular strain started in Wuhan Province. It traveled from animals to humans. She said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first.	Panelists: Beaumont Public Health Director Sherry Ulmer Beaumont Emergency Management Coordinator Tim Ocnashek BISD Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Anita Frank From Beaumont Psychiatric Clinic, Jason Mensah<EOS>Ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in Beaumont or Jefferson County.<EOS>She said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. With both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.  "We're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu." "If we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us."<EOS>She notes because COVID-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.<EOS>Ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in Texas, but Mensah says there are 51.  Ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.<EOS>I'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. I know (thanks to #TheDaily I think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.  So, mild is relative here.<EOS>Ulmer said she's hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine.<EOS>She says that's why it's important to continue "tried and true" healthcare methods. Wash your hands, stay home when you're sick.<EOS>Clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays.  Lysol, Clorox and 409 are CDC-approved to kill the virus.  "We understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours."<EOS>Feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread. He gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. He's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days.<EOS>Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. The virus is transmitted person-to-person. She says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.<EOS>That's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.<EOS>Ulmer said the health department is putting together "soemthing" so people know what the next step is if Jefferson County has a confirmed case.<EOS>(I'm going to use Tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.) So ... Tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures. That includes limiting crowds, increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1/2<EOS>measures.   I would like to add, as of Friday, the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds. The comment was at this time, danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken. 2/2<EOS>Tim says "we're not trying to scare people. There's a lot of bad information out there."  He encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on Facebook or from friends and spreading it like it's a fact.<EOS>"We would encourage people to be patient because it's a fluid situation." - Feldshau  He notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. However when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming.<EOS>Ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. And several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.<EOS>"We are as prepared as we can be with the information we're getting. Of course it's fluid, but we're accustomed to these types of situations."<EOS>Reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions. She said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are "doing very well."  "For our children it sounds like God has smiled on us."<EOS>Now talking about "flattening the curve." People are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.  "This is not here today and gone tomorrow." -Feldschau<EOS>Ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would "tax our healthcare system." Should the city/county get there, it would have to look at "alternative" ways to treat people. She didn't expand on what those alternatives are.<EOS>She said that's one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.<EOS>"I we know that you're coming, the staff can be ready for you. They can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2<EOS>as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus." 2/2<EOS>Feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.  "If we ever lose control, we're going to have a serious problem."<EOS>From comment section on the video:  "If this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) I‚Äôm not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? What is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don‚Äôt do it for flu?"<EOS>This seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. Someone simply responded "yassss" and another said people don't know what to do "so they just shut everything down I guess."<EOS>So even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ...<EOS>	nonrumour

#6: How does COVID-19 spread? A: We are learning more and more about how COVID-19 spreads. Evidence originally was very strong that it was present in the droplets of people who were infected. https://t.co/CkcUpqCTBM	When those people cough or sneeze the virus can be transmitted to others who breathe in the virus or if their hands become contaminated with the virus and then they touch their face.<EOS>There is more evidence that the virus lives on surfaces for long enough periods of time to be transmitted up to several days later. People who have no symptoms are also able to spread the virus.<EOS>This is part of the reason it is very hard to contain and slow the spread of COVID-19 without taking the current measures of social distancing. https://t.co/IcGH0U4t7i<EOS>	nonrumour

If they cough or sneeze without covering their mouths, or cover their mouths without washing hands after --&gt;<EOS>@catlady_chelsea and then touch you, or a door knob, or gas pump, or bag of chips that you then touch, it is transmitted.

How does COVID-19 spread?  Initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in Wuhan, China; and was then transmitted to humans. The current version of the SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person-to-person, similar to the flu. This usually happens when a sick person coughs or	What is COVID19?  Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).<EOS>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in Wuhan, China. The virus was previously termed ‚ÄúnCoV-2019‚Äù. At the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2, due to its similarities to the previous<EOS>SARS-CoV. The disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the WHO as Coronavirus Disease 2019, or ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù.<EOS>sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters).<EOS>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms can include:<EOS>‚Ä¢ Fever ‚Ä¢ Cough ‚Ä¢ Trouble breathing ‚Ä¢ Feeling tired ‚Ä¢ Muscle aches Most people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.<EOS>This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.<EOS>When should I see a doctor?  If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call 937 (The Saudi MOH Service Center) immediately. You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days:<EOS>‚Ä¢ You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus ‚Äì the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website: https://t.co/dGZNsC4CO8 ncov/travelers/index.html<EOS>‚Ä¢ You had close contact with a person who has the virus ‚Äì This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person. If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go.<EOS>If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. The staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people. If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead.<EOS>This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.<EOS>How is COVID-19 treated?  Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the "ICU").<EOS>There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen<EOS>(e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication.<EOS>Can COVID-19 be prevented?  There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19: ‚Ä¢ Wash your hands with soap and water often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to<EOS>the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. o If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.<EOS>‚Ä¢ Avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands ‚Ä¢ Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands immediately after (as specified above). ‚Ä¢ Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and<EOS>surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. ‚Ä¢ CDC does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. o Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to<EOS>help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has COVID-19. ‚Ä¢ Stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to COVID- 19.<EOS>‚Ä¢ Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection. ‚Ä¢ Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19.  If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:<EOS>‚Ä¢ Keep the sick person away from others ‚Äì The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible. ‚Ä¢ Use face masks ‚Äì The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person,<EOS>you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. This is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask. ‚Ä¢ Be extra careful around body fluids ‚Äì If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a<EOS>disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away. ‚Ä¢ Clean often ‚Äì It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets,<EOS>and bathroom surfaces. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. ‚Ä¢ Wash hands ‚Äì Wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above) ‚Ä¢ You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with<EOS>other people or pets in your home. There is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak? It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact<EOS>with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick. If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.<EOS>There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.<EOS>This way you will be able to receive and share information easily. If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk.<EOS>Where can I learn more?  As we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself. You can also find more information about COVID-19 at the<EOS>following: ‚Ä¢ United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): https://t.co/RdcPZBCkTp ‚Ä¢ World Health Organization (WHO): https://t.co/hRz3btHakL ‚Ä¢ The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH): https://t.co/4AU3FEoBn8 ‚Ä¢ Saudi MOH Coronavirus Service Center Number: 937<EOS>‚Ä¢ Saudi National Ambulance Hotline: 997<EOS>	nonrumour

#Coronavirus Myths You Mustn't believe RT to save someone   1. Hand dryers kill coronavirus  Hand dryers do not kill coronavirus. The best way to protect yourself and others from the virus is to wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.	2. Only older adults and young people are at risk  COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.<EOS>3. Everyone with COVID-19 dies  COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.

Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.	covid-19 myths vs truth https://t.co/QmasHPlOlL<EOS>You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.  Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.<EOS>Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm.<EOS>Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous  Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system- which helps fight against the virus.<EOS>COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates  From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials<EOS>Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.  There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases.

Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you<EOS>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.

@NAChristakis @marcelsalathe If that is the case, then according to this section of WHO, they are seemingly not in agreement that passing on the virus by people not showing symptoms is at all at that level.   "Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?"  https://t.co/XGBSWfHVLw	And here is new work, as of March 16 in @ScienceMagazine, using a modeling approach to show that "undocumented infections" (which are numerically more common than documented infections) were the original source of 79% of documented COVID-19 cases. https://t.co/6VwlckWqcc 29/<EOS>More evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID19, which I think we must now regard as the reality we are facing.

Sunday PSA, please read and share.  What is herd immunity in Ontario for COVID? Based on @imgrund calculations, about 2.1%  with only 1 in 11 cases of COVID detected. https://t.co/NQ4Dc29whj  Only 2.1% of population has had exposure = NO HERD IMMUNITY AND MUST BE CAREFUL!!	Perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don't matter. But they align very well with what Swiss researchers have found-- 11.6 cases for every 1 case detected. Most of the population of Geneva remains unexposed despite large case number.  https://t.co/SbJk1GNq7e https://t.co/iCeM0lE5hV<EOS>PLEASE--Wash your hands, wear masks, keep as far away from others and limit interactions. All these actions will help to keep you, your family, your neighbours, and our healthcare system healthy!!<EOS>So children are usually considered 'vectors of disease' and everyone believes that kids spread germs. But is this true for COVID? Could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are?  Summary work from Irish Health Technology group here...  https://t.co/1m3OzhZwEO<EOS>....and a link to the report they have published here üëá  https://t.co/gLl6Aw9i4T<EOS>What's going on with younger kids? Are they breathing less volume on people (yes, they are smaller)? Talk less forcefully? Do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids?   Or Is there something fundamentally different in their immune response?<EOS>Well it looks like policies aimed at kids may have a lesser impact on transmission of coronavirus infections.

Italy has been locked down since the 9th march (13 days) there will be cases coming in since before that. People won't be in hospital from day 1 of symptoms. Time Delay is the killer here. By the time it's visibly bad it will be too late.<EOS>@JamesDRog @Johnnypapa64 Ah ok. And where can I find all that information on the link you gave me?<EOS>@JamesDRog @Johnnypapa64 Right OK, so if the measures in Italy are successful then the death rate should be falling drastically over the next 2 days?<EOS>@JRWMFC @Johnnypapa64 Hopefully...

Brain teaser: Assume that 5% of the population has #COVID19 antibodies, and the serology test has a 95% accuracy (specificity=sensitivity=0.95). What is the probability p that I have antibodies if I test positive? (For bonus points explain your answer in comments)	@srchvrs Not needed to respond the teaser.<EOS>@joelgrus @xamat hence the answer is the "tricky" d) (which I did not get, because I wasn't watching for strict inequalities and thought I was picking "greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95")<EOS>@xamat 0.5 if you are a frequentist. If you are an hypochondriac Bayesian and you work in an hospital with COVID-19 patients, i.e., p(antibodies) &gt; 0.05, then the probability shifts towards 1.<EOS>@albertlumbreras If you apply Bayes you get the same result. Of course, things change if you change the prior, but that is unrelated to frequentist vs. bayesian.<EOS>@xamat Hint: Thomas Bayes would be of great help<EOS>@xamat Strict inequalities.<EOS>@xamat Prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly<EOS>@xamat P(covid=Y)=0.05 P(test=Y)=0.095 P(test=Y|covid=Y)=0.95<EOS>@xamat P(Covid=Y|test=Y)= P(test=Y|covid=Y) P(covid=Y) / P(test=Y) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5<EOS>@xamat I'm taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand. It's 50/50! üò± We have two random binary variables: TST (good test) and ATB (antibodies present). Plus one observable: RES(ult). Given same specificity and sensitivity, we can assume both vars are independent (?)<EOS>@xamat Thus, among four possible combinations of TST x ATB, we have two that lead to RES=positive, i.e., (TST and ATB) or (not TST and not ATB). P(TST,ATB)=P(not TST,not ATB)=0.0475. So, 50/50 between these two possibilities.<EOS>@xamat 50% https://t.co/YXKgAtfUSm<EOS>@xamat 400 person trial. 20 are positive. 380 negative. 361/380 of the negative test negative. 19/20 of the positive test positive.  But 19/380 negative test positive. Any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative.<EOS>@xamat If I test positive I am either a FP or a TP. The number of FPs is the number of negatives (95% of pop.) x the chance of misclassifying them (5%). The number of TPs is the number of positives (5% of the pop.) x the chance of correctly classifying them (95%). Hence, p=0.5.<EOS>@xamat Cheeky answer categories! I'm always entertained by how similar Bayes' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other.<EOS>@xamat 50% https://t.co/UHFkwXiQvR<EOS>@xamat One of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates<EOS>@xamat True positives (TP): .95*5% False positives (FP): .05*95% =  TP p = TP/(TP+FP) = 50%<EOS>@xamat But, here is the issue. I can say I have a magical prediction power. Simply, I predict a negative result for everybody. And I win over the lab test.... but I have zero sensitivity!<EOS>@xamat None of the above. It is 50%<EOS>@xamat =50%. Could use Bayes, but ppl don't understand that so do example:   Suppose 10k ppl tested.  at 5% incidence 500 have antibodies, 9500 don't.  .95*500 = 475 true positives.  0.05*9500 = 475 false negatives.  FN = TP so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5<EOS>	nonrumour

How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.	Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. ¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)<EOS>and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.<EOS>What is COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>Symptoms  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they<EOS>eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.¬† See previous answer on ‚ÄúHow does COVID-19 spread?‚Äù<EOS>	nonrumour

Lock-down, a containment scenario, where..<EOS>mandatory isolation diminishes the spread (blue);  had been evaluated using a model, for which to date no source code or parameters were made public.

Surprisingly, here the slope is even shallower than the ‚Äòmaximum control‚Äô slope. This suggests there is a feedback present, which decelerates the spread, in the model used to evaluate these strategic options. https://t.co/l2nlT9xuxM<EOS>Simplified Epidemic Modelling Epidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease, a one-way transfer is considered, where persons transfer from one bin to the next.

If the ...<EOS>symptomatic persons are in their ‚Äòinfectious bin‚Äô for a longer duration, as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons, this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly, i.e., a huge dampening effect.

What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.	What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.   1/3<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.   2/3<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  3/3<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   1/3<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   2/3<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  3/3<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.   1/2<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    2/2<EOS>	nonrumour

Q's 1-17  Q1: What is COVID-19? A1: It is the acronym for coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-COV-2.  Q2: What is SARS-COV-2? A2: It is the acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a virus.	It has been an honour working with  Prof Bhaswati Patnaik (Psy) and Prof Navaneeta Rath (Soc) on this FAQ wrt Serological Antibody Test in @bmcbbsr for #COVID19 @HealthCheck_in @IndiaSpend @WHO @ICMRDELHI @utkaluniv01 @NCDS_BBSR @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha https://t.co/DFZ08n9FiP<EOS>Q3: What is serological antibody test in the context of COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2? A3: Blood is taken from the veins and the serum/plasma put to a test to know whether the person has developed antibodies against the virus, SARS-COV-2, for the disease, COVID-19.<EOS>Q4: How long it takes to give the result of the serological antibody test? A4: It takes 15-30 minutes to get the result of the test. So, it is a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).<EOS>Q5: Who would have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19?  A5: Only people who were infected by SARS-COV-2 and had the disease COVID-19 are likely to have developed antibodies against SARS-COV-2/COVID-19.<EOS>Q6: Why is the test conducted on population who are not known to have COVID-19? A6: Some people might have been infected but were either asymptomatic or were with symptoms but have not been tested. Hence, the test is conducted on population who are not known to have it.<EOS>Q7:  Why the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar, not in other cities of Odisha? A7: As Bhubaneswar has been declared as a hotspot and there is likelihood for the rapid spread in the city and from the city to other cities, the test has been initiated in Bhubaneswar.<EOS>Q8: What is the purpose of the test? A8:  The purpose of the test is to help in disease surveillance. It will help us arrive at an estimate of how many people from different categories of population in Bhubaneswar that might have been affected.<EOS>Q9:  Apart from random sampling for testing the population, who else can go for the antibody test? A9: Samples of people with Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza like Illness (ILI) are also being collected apart from random sampling of asymptomatic people.<EOS>Q10: Who will identify the population and design the sample to be tested? A10: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) through experts from the health department have developed protocols for identifying population from among whom the sample is to be drawn for testing.<EOS>Q11: What will happen if the antibody test comes positive? A11: If the antibody test comes positive, the person‚Äôs swab samples may be sent for RT-PCR test. This is another confirmatory test to know whether the person is currently suffering from COVID-19.<EOS>Q.12: Will serological antibody test help identify a person suffering from COVID-19? A12: No, as per current practise and guidelines from @WHO &amp; @ICMRDELHI, COVID-19 +ve cases are to be identified through RT-PCR in designated laboratories/testing centres.<EOS>Q13: Will identifying people who have developed antibodies be helpful in treatment for those who are suffering from COVID-19? A13:  An independent research protocol has to be developed where plasma from those who developed antibodies can be used to treat patients.<EOS>Q14: Will those identified with antibodies for COVID-19 be immune from the disease? A14: Further research with people who have already developed antibodies will be required.<EOS>Q.15: Whom should the residents of the city contact for the test? A15: The residents of the city may contact their respective RWA (Resident Welfare Association), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) or ward officer for the test.<EOS>Q16: Where from these rapid kits have come to the state? A16: These rapid kits have been procured by @ICMRDELHI and have been supplied to Odisha.<EOS>Q17: How many rapid kits have been provided to Government of Odisha in the first phase? A17: @ICMRDELHI has provided 6000 rapid kits for the test to Odisha in the first phase.  @bmcbbsr @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha<EOS>The Odia version of the policy brief FAQs on rapid antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 is now put up by @NCDS_BBSR   @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha @bmcbbsr @ICMR_RMRCBBSR https://t.co/HYHyN0hKw2<EOS>I am happy to share that @NCDS_BBSR policy brief 17a (‡≠ß‡≠≠‡¨ï) has been put up online by @samajalive https://t.co/JGULs90jCq  @HFWOdisha @IPR_Odisha @bmcbbsr<EOS>Have there been any studies on efficacy of treatment thtough plasma of recovered patients. @PIB_India @ICMRDELHI @MoHFW_INDIA https://t.co/YeoS1Pc5Iw<EOS>In statistical terms, the spike in new cases for 18th April should be considered as noise or outlier.

So another important data point to review each day is the percent positive of all patients tested, by PCR and Serology test types. What is ‚Äúpercent positive‚Äù? Out of the total number of Missourians tested, it is the percentage that have had a positive test result.	For June 1, that percentage was 6.5% for PCR tests and 4% for Serology tests. https://t.co/6iLd4i4el6<EOS>You can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in Missouri, and how many of those were positive. If you view that table, you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable, while the total number of tests daily has increased.<EOS>That means the percentage of Missourians being diagnosed with COVID-19 is lowering.<EOS>To view this information to help understand the full picture, visit https://t.co/72uSkl2FXy and select COVD-19 Dashboard.

1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?  Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.	The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.  Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ<EOS>2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?  No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).<EOS>3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.<EOS>4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?  UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.<EOS>5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?  No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.<EOS>6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.<EOS>7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?  No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.<EOS>8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.  However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.<EOS>	nonrumour

@carvillshill That's what I dont understand. If NYC is saying 25% of people have had it (or whatever), what is stopping the other 75% getting it (or at least 35% before you get herd immunity) &amp; dying at a rate of c0.7%? There is zero logic to it, unless you believe the serology number is wrong	FYI those engaging with my tweet re NZ: I am very convinced by Prof Michael Levitt‚Äôs logic in this interview- it‚Äôs a must watch. ¬†@UnHerd https://t.co/m4zTfd70aY<EOS>Key takeaways: Covid infections are never exponential and infection rates start to slow quite quickly after a proportion of the population become infected.

If he's wrong, it's absolutely horrible.<EOS>@jamesaknight Well, the pattern of each local epidemic since the first 2 in China, on to South Korea, Iran and Italy have all been very similar.

Everyone with COVID-19 dies  This statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.	In a recent report, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that 80.9% of COVID-19 cases were mild.  The WHO also report that around 80% of people will experience a relatively mild form of the disease, which will not require specialist treatment<EOS>	rumour

@matthewrobb701 Possibly;  but one has to ask oneself what is different now from before.  The virus is no different.

9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.	Thread about some popular myths on corona virus  1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin  These cannot kill viruses within the body!!<EOS>2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.<EOS>6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus  https://t.co/speJA9BUHu<EOS>7. Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter. https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa<EOS>8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself<EOS>9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.<EOS>10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.<EOS>14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID-19 symptoms only 2‚Äì10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.<EOS>15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.  So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray.

@LucioMM1 @mindtapes Guarda la sezione "What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?" nelle FAQ per il pubblico e vedi tutti i suggerimenti che danno alle persone per ridurre al minimo il contagio	@KegOfGrog @mindtapes s√¨ ho risposto in modo analogo anche io e concordo, ed √® proprio posta male la domanda. Cmq √® ulteriormente complesso perch√® nn √® banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia "la vera scienza".<EOS>@LucioMM1 @mindtapes La domanda secondo me √® assolutamente legittima. Non √® che √® posta male, ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti. "A chi devo fare riferimento?", "di chi mi devo fidare", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso.<EOS>@LucioMM1 @mindtapes La comunit√† scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi √® ci√≤ che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalit√†. A prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza.<EOS>@KegOfGrog @mindtapes ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. Burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi. "state a casa" nn √® un claim scientifico. E' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. Non √® scienza /<EOS>@KegOfGrog @mindtapes scienza √® dire "se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce". Il "quindi state a casa a qualunque costo" non √® scienza.<EOS>@LucioMM1 @mindtapes No. L'OMS ha detto che stare a casa √® il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. Non probabilmente. Lo hanno affermato con certezza. Ed √® confermato dai numeri.  Non lo dice Burioni, n√© nessun altro. Lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanit√†.<EOS>@KegOfGrog @mindtapes cmq no, √® scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa √® uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. Se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. Partendo da l√¨, possiamo capire come il dire cosa "minimizza" nn serve mai a nulla.<EOS>@LucioMM1 @mindtapes Quindi secondo te l'OMS dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? A che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chiss√† quanta gente √® contagiata?<EOS>@LucioMM1 @mindtapes Se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio √® l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione.<EOS>@KegOfGrog @mindtapes definisci "migliore". Nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. Poi politica sceglie con loro ZITTI MENTRE SI SCEGLIE.<EOS>@LucioMM1 @mindtapes La politica anche √® responsabile della "intromissione" degli scienziati, eh. Se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani.<EOS>@KegOfGrog @mindtapes ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. Loro devono dire "chiusura fabbrica impatta X su tassi di contagio". Poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori.<EOS>	nonrumour

@MuffinTimeYay @BlikstadK @BarbaraLevinbb @Bill_Maxwell_ What is herd immunity?  Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely.	Will you keep wearing masks and limiting your trips out until there is a vaccine widely available?<EOS>@Bill_Maxwell_ Yep. Viruses don't disappear. Just look at measles. Controlled, literally no cases in western world until anti-vaxers. Measles are making a come back. Virus didn't disappear, just waited for stupid people to not vaccinate.<EOS>@BarbaraLevinbb @Bill_Maxwell_ If vaccines work for the vaccinated, why does it matter if others choose to not vaccinate? If you're vaccines do not work then why bother with them at all?<EOS>@Grandmumzie @BarbaraLevinbb @Bill_Maxwell_ Seriously?  No medical knowledge at all, eh?  What about those who can‚Äôt get vaccinated?  What about those who choose not to?  We eradicated diseases until people got complacent.<EOS>@BlikstadK @BarbaraLevinbb @Bill_Maxwell_ Plenty of medical knowledge here. I have reversed more medical conditions than most because I choose to be healthy. I make healthy choices. If you do not want to succumb to viruses help those who are sick get healthy. Contrary to popular belief it can be done.<EOS>@MuffinTimeYay @BlikstadK @BarbaraLevinbb @Bill_Maxwell_ Do some research in 2017 59 million people died worldwide. If you are conceived it is only natural that you will eventually die. No one is guaranteed one minute five years 30 years or a hundred years. That is life. The strong will survive.

Part 10  Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However,  #FREDIBOAT	Part 6  How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 11  many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.¬†  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 12  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.¬†¬†¬†¬† #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 13  Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 14   route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 15  Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 16  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 20  surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<EOS>Part 22  cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 23  have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 24  Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 25  You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.  **********  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading  Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 26  everyone)  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 27  to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 28 Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 29  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?  The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around<EOS>Part 30  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to<EOS>Part 31  comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 32  China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)	From respiratory (saliva, nasal mucus,) droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.<EOS>Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. #Covid_19   8/n	Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection. #Covid_19   6/n<EOS>MYTH-04: THE NEW CORONAVIRUS CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH MOSQUITO BITES.  To date,there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.  7/n<EOS>MYTH-06: CAN AN ULTRAVIOLET DISINFECTION LAMP KILL THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. #Covid_19   9/n<EOS>MYTH-07: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THERMAL SCANNERS IN DETECTING PEOPLE INFECTED WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.  10/n<EOS>MYTH-08: CAN SPRAYING ALCOHOL OR CHLORINE ALL OVER YOUR BODY KILL THE NEW CORONAVIRUS?

Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia	Q. What is a CoronaVirus? A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.  #coronavirus #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. What is COVID-19? A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus<EOS>Q. How fatal is COVID-19? A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. How does COVID-19 spreads? A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates<EOS>[2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus<EOS>[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.<EOS>[2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia<EOS>	nonrumour

5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19  Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.

What am I trying to say? Everybody has their lane. That a particular trade is booming for someone you know does not mean it will boom for you. You do not know what they know. Forget the glamorous results you see, people's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly.	Many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself 'why not me?' When will it be my own turn? Do they have two heads? etc.   No! Nothing is wrong with you. Just discover your own lane and press forward. YOU ARE YOU!!!<EOS>Most people will not even write about their failures. I AM SUPER PROUD OF MY FAILURES. I failed forward. My failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business.<EOS>Your failures are a plus. You learn never to do things that same way. Reason I embraced the lean approach. I learnt how to start a business with a very little cost, validate and then grow it. https://t.co/SWKhjcXLsr (@ePoultryNG) is a clear example. I will tell the story some day<EOS>By God's Grace (ALL GLORY TO GOD), doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from President Obama through his Foundation, the Dutch Government, The Wharton School, Ventures Platform, Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria...<EOS>Others are Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) - a network of 121 Vice Chancellors of African Universities, Federal Government of Nigeria, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)...<EOS>Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Embassy of France in Nigeria, Bank of Industry, African Entrepreneurship Awards, Morocco, and several others.<EOS>Because of my work as an entrepreneur, I have had FREE, and I mean COMPLETELY FREE trips to some countries in Africa and Europe. It looks like I am bragging but I am actually not.<EOS>There were times I applied for these things - put myself forward, pushed and pushed and I always got a NO! For me to share one award, recognition or free travel that came my way, I may have gotten NOs in a multiple of 10, if not 20.<EOS>There is a particular annual fellowship I have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years. I will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected. That is how it is.<EOS>You have to develop a thick skin to getting NOs, see them as part of the process and forge ahead. You have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly. You have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race.<EOS>Do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition. We are not wired to do the same things.   You also have to stay HUMBLE. Little accolades should not get to your head. If it does, your dreams are so small. Increase the elasticity.<EOS>I moved to another city and drowned myself in Bishop David Oyedepo's book - UNDERSTANDING DIVINE DIRECTION.   I tried applying for jobs during this period and never did I get one. See, I have a very great CV, good schools, excellent grades and awesome work experience.<EOS>As at that time, I had worked for an Impact Accelerator and Consulting firm in Nairobi, did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences.<EOS>The first test invite I got, I passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day. I was equally successful and was called to see the CEO which was the last stage of the recruitment process. Maybe my price scared them, I was not called back as promised.<EOS>The second one I ever got much later, I argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything. LOL.   I didn't get both jobs. Thank God. I am sure God was looking at me and shaking his head like "see this boy I gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else".<EOS>Discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly. This does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work. You will work extra hard and even harder as you go up. Succeeding is easy. Staying successful is not.<EOS>That does not mean you will not celebrate your wins. Celebrate them. Enjoy them. But you know what, move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more.<EOS>I HAVE MY STORY! YOU HAVE YOURS!   They are never the same even though our results might be similar. It could even bring us plenty money and fame. But it is never the same.<EOS>Finally, success is not even about the money and the fame alone. It is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled. Only that, money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter.   Just find your lane, stay there and run your race.   Dazzol.  Blessed weekend.<EOS>	nonrumour

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	Let¬¥s help fight the spread of the coronavirus. Let¬¥s protect ourselves, our loved ones, colleagues, friends, the community and our country. So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization. #CovidfreeApril #CovidfreePhilippines #CovidfreeWorld<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.   2/3<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  3/3<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   1/3<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   2/3<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  3/3<EOS>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.   1/2<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    2/2<EOS>	nonrumour

9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?  Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.<EOS>2. Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?  No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Rather, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (eyes, mouth).<EOS>3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.<EOS>4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?  UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.<EOS>5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?  No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.<EOS>6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.<EOS>7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?  No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.<EOS>8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.  However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.<EOS>	nonrumour

What is a coronavirus?  Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS. The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19.	I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.  It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.<EOS>What is COVID-19?   COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.  This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.  Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.  These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms.<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.   People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread?   People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.   The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.<EOS>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?   The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.<EOS>Should I worry about COVID-19?   Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults.   It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.  The mask can only be used once. If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.<EOS>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.<EOS>Is there anything I should not do?   The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  1. Smoking  2. Taking traditional herbal remedies   3. Wearing multiple masks   4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.<EOS>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.  #CoronaAlert  #coronavirus  #CoronaOutbreak #Thread<EOS>	nonrumour

Top 5 #Covid-19 Myth busters according to World Health Organization (@who )  1. Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  2. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites... https://t.co/smzaL9zgAk	3. Contracting the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.  4. Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous.  5. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates...<EOS>The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently washing your hands. üßºüß¥üßº<EOS>	nonrumour
This is serious. You *think* you are safe, being constrained to ur house, putting masks on when outside. But are you really? The delivery packages/folks you come in contact with, the food you order, the grocery shelves you touch...the virus can get to you from anywhere. Stay safe https://t.co/MyMIVVQrJ8	@hbk_abhi Correct.

Part 16  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.  #FREDIBOAT	Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 19  droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 20  surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<EOS>Part 22  cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 23  have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 24  Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 25  You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.  **********  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading  Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 26  everyone)  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 27  to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 28 Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 29  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?  The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around<EOS>Part 30  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to<EOS>Part 31  comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 32  China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.  You can see these at¬†https://t.co/IsbnwJ3QWg<EOS>Part 28  and other viruses.  If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.<EOS>	nonrumour

Q. What is a CoronaVirus? A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.  #coronavirus #coronavirusindia	Q. What is COVID-19? A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus<EOS>Q. How fatal is COVID-19? A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. How does COVID-19 spreads? A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates<EOS>[2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus<EOS>[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia<EOS>Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.<EOS>[2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia<EOS>	nonrumour

How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?  1.

Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).  4/10<EOS>5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).  5/10<EOS>6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.  6/10<EOS>7. Pull down the mask‚Äôs bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.  7/10<EOS>8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.  8/10<EOS>9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.  9/10<EOS>10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask ‚Äì Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.  10/10<EOS>	nonrumour

@kelly_jasper_88 @kelly_rdc @JimInNC Is COVID-19 airborne? I don‚Äôt think it is, but it would be good to confirm that. If it‚Äôs not, then contact is needed to contract it.

I may be wrong but that's my view.<EOS>@kelly_jasper_88 @Butterfly6875 @kelly_rdc YES!  It is airborne and much of the spreading is due to that. We're told to stay a MINIMUM of 3 feet (~1 meter) from other people, and 6 feet is strongly recommended.  When you cough it easily travels 3 feet, 6 feet for a deep cough.  NEVER touch your face.<EOS>	nonrumour

Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.  The mask can only be used once. If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.	The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, &amp; dry cough.  Some patients may have aches &amp; pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.  These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.<EOS>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.<EOS>Is there anything I should not do?   The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  1. Smoking  2. Taking traditional herbal remedies   3. Wearing multiple masks   4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.<EOS>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.  #CoronaAlert  #coronavirus  #CoronaOutbreak #Thread<EOS>	nonrumour

In the race to stop the spread of COVID-19, some are wondering if #HerdImmunity is the answer. But what is that exactly?	Here's what things look like now: https://t.co/trt55Bfvj5<EOS>For this to work, 70 percent of the population would need to have immunity. That's 229,767,666 people in the U.S. alone. https://t.co/fwVs57MhDq<EOS>Scientists reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious COVID-19 is specifically. This is called R0 value. It measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. This is how COVID-19's R0 values compare to other diseases. https://t.co/BzRjrVVXvb<EOS>Even though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance, most scientists aren't onboard with relying on #HerdImmunity. Why? This tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the U.S. and 30 million around the world. That's millions too many. https://t.co/nvzOWYbOuk<EOS>Until a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain. The alternative would be devastating.<EOS>Experts also noted that by social distancing, we can mimic this tactic. Staying six feet away from others also prevents the virus from bouncing to a new person.<EOS>Interested in learning more about COVID-19 and #HerdImmunity? @madsburk has more here‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/fnNRmL0fYD<EOS>Here's what that looks like: https://t.co/sqGYbnfLvA<EOS>	nonrumour

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?‚ÄØ¬†  Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.	These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19.¬† Always use hand sanitizer to clean your hands always. #Fightcovid19<EOS>	nonrumour

Q‚ÄîCan Humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?  A‚ÄîYes, such instances have happened in past in 2002 in China &amp; 2012 in Saudi Arabia. But with different virus<EOS>5.  symptoms of someone infected  A-Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.<EOS>6. Can Coronavirus be transmitted from person to person?  A-- Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household workplace, or health care centre. #coronarovirus #coronavirusindia<EOS>7. Who is at higher risk of infection by nCoV?  A-- Highest risk is among people are at extremes of age or have existence of other infections.<EOS>8. ¬†Is there a vaccine for Novel Coronavirus ?  A--When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can take a number of years for a new vaccine to be developed. #coronarovirus #coronavirusindia<EOS>9.What are the treatment for infection?

Is there anything I should not do?   The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  1. Smoking  2. Taking traditional herbal remedies   3. Wearing multiple masks   4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.	How does COVID-19 spread?   People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.   The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.  The mask can only be used once. If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.<EOS>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.<EOS>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.  #CoronaAlert  #coronavirus  #CoronaOutbreak #Thread<EOS>	nonrumour

While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this  #FREDIBOAT	Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However,  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 14   route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 15  Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 16  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the¬†spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 19  droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 20  surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<EOS>Part 22  cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 23  have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 24  Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 25  You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.  **********  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading  Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 26  everyone)  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 27  to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 28 Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 29  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?  The risk depends on where you ¬†are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around<EOS>Part 30  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to<EOS>Part 31  comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 32  China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly.

So people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies (serology) from the total. Is this consistent with what is being observed? #COVID19  9/x	A ubiquitous assumption made is, that at the start, all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as SAR-CoV-2. But is this assumption always correct? #COVID19 7/x<EOS>As a pandemic evolves, the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered. It is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease. #COVID19 8/x<EOS>Most serologic assays have ranged from 1-3% all the way up to 20-30% in areas such as New York City. And the curve seems to be ending in NYC.  What gives? #COVID19 10/x<EOS>Similarly, in a recent study of an isolated Alpine community in Austria shows that even in a close-knit community only a fraction of people became infected. #COVID19 11/x https://t.co/Cm1oOVu6sq<EOS>It seems the pandemic has stopped in that community, with a high antibody prevalence of 42.4%. Notably, children were less likely to be infected. #COVID19 12/x<EOS>In another study, it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected, with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ACE2 receptor. #COVID19  13/x https://t.co/9dCFn1sNuL<EOS>Another fascinating study of a ship expedition to the Antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected. H/T @vmontori  #COVID19  14/x https://t.co/vCU1r6eTpj<EOS>So it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific SAR-COV-2 protective antibodies. #COVID19  15/x<EOS>How could this be? Is it possible not all are likely to be infected? I suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical. I will share two possibilities others have explored. #COVID19  16/x<EOS>The most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human/primates/mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross-immunity derived from other coronaviruses. #COVID19  17/x<EOS>This is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure. Perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past! Thank you! #COVID19  18/x https://t.co/BHgM1pgd3w https://t.co/7eN7N65DZg<EOS>How could we be protected? It is impossible to tell. Our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science.  Maybe polymorphisms in receptors, immunity, or other ways. We might never know. But we do know evolutionary pathways select #COVID19  19/x<EOS>Another possibility is cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses. One such study has shown that as a possibility. They found T cell reactivity from viable T cells stored before SARS-CoV-2. In nearly one-half of cases! #COVID19  20/x https://t.co/F9PSvm0yPk<EOS>This study was small but very provocative. If confirmed, this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the "S" (as in susceptible). In other words, you can be functionally "immune" even if not exposed #COVID19 21/x https://t.co/SiVFzgVaK5<EOS>Importantly, and somewhat obvious, they will not have typical SAR-CoV-2 antibodies. But they may still have protective cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses. #COVID19  22/x<EOS>It would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick. Low hanging fruit! #COVID19 23/x https://t.co/uEjyNC7O3w<EOS>Modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets (proteome) of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies. #COVID19  24/x<EOS>It is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross-immunity. That would explain why there are clusters among families or friends.  And also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers. #COVID19 25/x<EOS>Globally we have heard from colleagues in Peru, Ecuador and Greece saying ‚Äúthe parking lots were full, we had no more beds.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.	and have been implicated in gastroenteritis in infants. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a worldwide outbreak of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong south China.<EOS>It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging<EOS>from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.<EOS>What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>	nonrumour
Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. #OpenParlyZW	The best way to protect yourself against #COVID19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Hand dryers are not effective in killing #COVID19 . To protect yourself against the new #coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new #coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new #coronavirus. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new #coronavirus #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). #OpenParlyZW<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care #OpenParlyZW<EOS>	nonrumour

The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.   #PEDULIWA19<EOS>The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for a few hours to several days, but simple disinfectants can kill it. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets, rather than through the air.<EOS>How can I protect myself and others from COVID-19?  #PEDULIWA19<EOS>1.

But any age is still just as contagious as the next.<EOS>You can have COVID-19 and not show a single symptom. Then go visit your grandparent/parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint. So many people are so uneducated on COVID-19. Yes the media has completely overblown this.<EOS>The only way to allow the medical field to catch up is SOCIAL DISTANCE yourself. If you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly (e.i. China &amp; Italy) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with COVID-19 that may or may not be in<EOS>a critical condition. On top of that that, it‚Äôs the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up, then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out. It‚Äôs not a beat it, it‚Äôs a slow it down.<EOS>As young people in society it‚Äôs our duty to slow this virus down. Avoid social gatherings, avoid large crowds, wash your fucking hands, wipe down machines at the gym, socially distance yourself. If you have mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young, and this really doesn‚Äôt effect me‚Äù, then not only<EOS>are you being selfish but you‚Äôre the route cause for spreading. In 2 weeks, the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies (medical, emergency, food sources) are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all@of this.<EOS>	rumour

It is relatively easy to kill as caught in early stages<EOS>@streetway161 @EmiConsultant @anthonyrpryor @deAdder @TheHillTimes The human body is at a constant temp.. even when the exterior is hotter. So, 85¬∞ F would ( possibly kill of surface virus).. but you cannot increase  body temp 30¬∞C ..without killing them ,  maybe  you can just pop them in a oven for a while ? Lol...<EOS>@sheilaghmcgrory @EmiConsultant @anthonyrpryor @deAdder @TheHillTimes Virus lives on surfaces such as tongue, nostrils, throat for a long time before it reaches  lungs. Inhaling warm air such as in a sauna or hot environment would kill or inhibit growth of virus on these surfaces. Sunshine, sauna, coughing out phlegm with the virus is recommended.<EOS>@sheilaghmcgrory @EmiConsultant @anthonyrpryor @deAdder @TheHillTimes Sure. Just take the stats from Mexico.

*Can I catch COVID-19 from feces, animals, pets, surfaces or packages?*  üöΩ *Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?*  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.	While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.<EOS>Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.   üêæ *Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?* Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.<EOS>Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.<EOS>To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times.<EOS>Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.<EOS>üê∂ *Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?* There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.<EOS>	nonrumour

6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.	The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.  Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ<EOS>1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?  Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.<EOS>4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?  UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.<EOS>5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?  No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.<EOS>7.

The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.<EOS>8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.

Is Covid-19 airborne?  The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces.  #Youth4impact #KeepAkuseSafe‚ùó https://t.co/j5LsK2i128	You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands.  Please STAY Home and keep Akuse safe.  #Youth4impact #KeepAkuseSafe<EOS>@AkuseY4Impact https://t.co/HYlwr8rpIj<EOS>	nonrumour

Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.	HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?  ü§ß People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.   üí¶ The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.<EOS>ü•Ñ These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   üëà Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   ‚ÜîÔ∏è People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who<EOS>coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    #WHOWhatsapp<EOS>	nonrumour

Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China? Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. https://t.co/h8kjFn9QfU	Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/7jK6SA3bkC<EOS>Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus? No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).<EOS>Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/eV03fM0bNT<EOS>Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.<EOS>This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans. https://t.co/8kv46hjSYh<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.<EOS>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/HN7yBWhYlQ<EOS>Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/X63kY0i8o3<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX<EOS>Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body? No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%<EOS>ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform. However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to<EOS>be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.¬†  WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat<EOS>symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

@anilvohra69 What is your take on the pre-existing cross-immunity idea and how it affects the herd immunity number?  Some estimates suggest that 50% or more of the population may not be susceptible at all to Covid.  Herd immunity may therefore kick in much sooner in the US.	@anilvohra69 Agreed we are probably some ways off.  But then again, no one knows how much cross-immunity different populations may have.  Is it 30%, 50%, 80%?  Brazil seems to be doing the least to suppress it, so that may be one place to watch.<EOS>	nonrumour
@SueCar11 @whatever_katie @marcorubio @GovRonDeSantis Again, what percentage do we need to be infected to reach herd immunity and what is the mortality rate according to you?	Unfortunately high Covid #‚Äôs are now baked in for next 2-3 weeks because they reflect infections 7 to 21 days earlier. Focus now must be getting numbers to plateau &amp; start falling by mid-July &amp; preventing young &amp; healthy people from infecting those older &amp;/or at higher risk<EOS>@marcorubio Need to shut Florida down...  @GovRonDeSantis looks like he is in a race to catch New York.<EOS>@SueCar11 @whatever_katie @marcorubio @GovRonDeSantis That‚Äôs completely incorrect.

Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.<EOS>You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.  Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.<EOS>Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever.

Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.	Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.   People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?

MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT CORONA VIRUS ACCORDING TO WHO Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your	bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). #OpenParlyZW	Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching #COVID19 .Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5¬∞C to 37¬∞C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.  #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Hand dryers are not effective in killing #COVID19 . To protect yourself against the new #coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new #coronavirus ? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new #coronavirus. #OpenParlyZW<EOS>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever #OpenParlyZW<EOS>Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.

So here¬¥s a thread of Q&amp;A on coronaviruses (COVID-19) from World Health Organization. #CovidfreeApril #CovidfreePhilippines #CovidfreeWorld<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.   2/3<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  3/3<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   2/3<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  3/3<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.   1/2<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    2/2<EOS>	nonrumour

Not to mention the studies in Santa Clara and new York.  It's time we see we've been fooled. https://t.co/vXpq7frEGe	There‚Äôs a self sorting going on, and no government can stop it...  Those who wish to remain quarantined are, those choosing normal life over the risks are...  It‚Äôs immoral and destructive to keep things locked down when there is no fear of a health care system...<EOS>@NolteNC @jkc_jaycee As long as you return to your beaches in your state and stay out of my state will be good with the beaches.Look at the I-10 corridor from Texas to Florida and you can see where the spring breakers and vacationers came through in February that whole corridor is contaminated.<EOS>@jrharrison1 @NolteNC @jkc_jaycee Contaminated.

Q. How long does the virus survive on surfaces?  A. Studies suggest that #coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the #COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days... (A threadüëá)	This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).<EOS>If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Wash your hands with soap and water or clean them hands with an alcohol-based hand rub.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?<EOS>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.

Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why?<EOS>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why?<EOS>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why?<EOS>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.<EOS>Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.<EOS>This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have++<EOS>diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.	Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.<EOS>By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. https://t.co/H8M0OgibEU<EOS>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites. To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.<EOS>The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.<EOS>To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. https://t.co/kSdfGWv5GI<EOS>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus? No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<EOS>Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. https://t.co/sJhxDjdhrA<EOS>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG<EOS>How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn<EOS>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.<EOS>Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP<EOS>Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease? - Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.	Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets.<EOS>- Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. - Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. #COVID„Éº19 #COVID<EOS>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. #COVID„Éº19 #COVID #COVID19france #COVID19france #Covid_19<EOS>	nonrumour
@dlbvet Historically it has been to do serology or blood tests for pathogen-specific antibodies. This study suggests that this may not be as useful over time.  Which brings up other than live virus re-exposure tests, if there is protection, what is the best test? again, time will tell.	@dlbvet 2/n we know that immune protection exists in animal and monkey testing upon re-exposure. However, many have used antibody titers as a test to check immune memory in the clinic. This may unfortunately not be as useful for Covid-19.<EOS>@dlbvet Booster vaccine shots can be given if needed. However, we don‚Äôt know how those who‚Äôve been infected already, but then have reduced antibody levels, will respond to re-exposure. The same or different?  For those who haven‚Äôt had it yet, no one wants to run that risk.<EOS>	nonrumour

How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.	Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>World Health Organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. https://t.co/OiusUGcg8F<EOS>	nonrumour

What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.	What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to<EOS>more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19<EOS>These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.<EOS>Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.<EOS>People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. T<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets<EOS>from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.<EOS>	nonrumour

How long does the virus survive on surfaces? (source World Health Organization) It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information.	How long does the virus survive on surfaces? (source World Health Organization)  on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).<EOS>If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:<EOS>13.(B) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<EOS>13. (C) Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.<EOS>13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.<EOS>	nonrumour

From the @WHO:  Q: I‚Äôm pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?  A: Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. You can help protect yourself by:  #TakeResponsibility #GetItTogetherNG #GetIttogether #StaySafe	1. Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 2. Keeping space between yourselves and others and avoiding crowded spaces.  #TakeResponsibility #GetItTogetherNG #GetIttogether #StaySafe<EOS>3. Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. 4. Practicing respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.  #TakeResponsibility #GetItTogetherNG #GetItTogether<EOS>5. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Call before going to a health facility, and follow the directions of your local health authority.  #TakeResponsibility #GetItTogetherNG #GetIttogether #StaySafe<EOS>Pregnant women and women who have recently delivered ‚Äì including those affected by COVID-19 - should attend their routine care appointments.   #TakeResponsibility #GetItTogetherNG #GetIttogether #StaySafe<EOS>	nonrumour

As well as costing hundreds of thousands of lives, #HerdImmunity would depend on people developing immunity to #COVID19, which is not certain.  Antibodies don‚Äôt equal immunity &amp; immunity to other human coronaviruses (e.g SARS &amp; MERS) is only temporary. https://t.co/mSLSIsASG2<EOS>9/. The govt deny #HerdImmunity was ever their strategy.  Many think it was, until the 16 March when new data emerged.

@thatdanhanna @Johnathan_Wood1 What is the goal of a vaccine? You guessed it. Herd immunity! Not everyone can take a vaccine. People used to have measle and chicken pox parties to get it over with. I‚Äôm not saying covid is the same disease but this idea you have to hide until there‚Äôs a vaccine is moronic	@Angrydoc24 @thatdanhanna That's just plain not true. We're not declining as a whole around the country but are holding fairly steady as some states improve but others get worse.   And I notice you conveniently ignored all of the data I shared providing context to your first graph.<EOS>@Johnathan_Wood1 @thatdanhanna I didn‚Äôt ignore anything. Arguing on social media solves nothing. You‚Äôll have your opinion no matter what I share.<EOS>@Johnathan_Wood1 @thatdanhanna The fact of the matter is the general population of 18 to 50 that is relatively healthy is going to need to be exposed to Covid. It‚Äôs called developing heard immunity. Hiding in your house from the virus like it‚Äôs a cat burglar does not work. I‚Äôm not saying not to wear your mask.<EOS>@Angrydoc24 @Johnathan_Wood1 This is false. The vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases. There is no need to risk people‚Äôs lives until the vaccine because you don‚Äôt like a mask.<EOS>@Angrydoc24 @Johnathan_Wood1 You‚Äôd rather knowingly let people die to achieve a goal that we will achieve in 6 months without the unnecessary deaths... WAIT FOR IT... so you don‚Äôt have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth sometimes...  Bless your heart. Good bye<EOS>	nonrumour
What is a Novel Coronavirus?  A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that hasn't been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isn't the same as the¬†coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans¬†&amp; cause mild illness like the common cold.	A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis.  Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.<EOS>	nonrumour

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.   1/2	What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.<EOS>Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.   2/3<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  3/3<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   1/3<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.   2/3<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  3/3<EOS>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.<EOS>However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.    2/2<EOS>	nonrumour

Apart from respiratory droplets infections, this virus has got other high infectious properties. It can enter your body through nose, eyes, mouth hence social distancing and regular hand wash is very important.<EOS>@karunanundy What if droplets from an infected persons sneeze are floating in the air?  The problem here is because this is a new virus, there are  many contradictory messages floating around. Like, those without symptoms need not wear a mask. But, many infected persons dont have symptoms.<EOS>	nonrumour

Clear evidence of only two type of countries being able to eliminate this - strong willed small countries like NZ or autocracy like China.<EOS>@Amresh_Kumar_15 @ranajayghosh I guess as long as mortality rate is less than half a percent (seems like that if one goes by the antibody testing method)...might just be one more disease?<EOS>	nonrumour
