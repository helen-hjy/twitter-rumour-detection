How does COVID-19 spread?   People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.   The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.	I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.  It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.<EOS>What is a coronavirus?  Coronavirus is a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from common cold to MERS &amp; SARS. The most recently discovered coronavirus is COVID-19.<EOS>Should I worry about COVID-19?   Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults.   It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.  The mask can only be used once. If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.<EOS>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.<EOS>Is there anything I should not do?   The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  1. Smoking  2. Taking traditional herbal remedies   3. Wearing multiple masks   4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.<EOS>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.  #CoronaAlert  #coronavirus  #CoronaOutbreak #Thread<EOS>	nonrumour

The new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. #COVID19NIGERIA #CoronaVirusInNigeria #CoronaVirusNigeria #StayAtHomeChallenge #StopTheSpread #Chloroquine<EOS>Myth: If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you don't have a coronavirus infection.

According to WHO:  Drinking methanol, ethanol or bleach DOES NOT prevent or cure COVID-19 and can be extremely dangerous Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are poisons. Drinking them can lead to disability and death.	Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them. They will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.<EOS>To protect yourself against COVID-19, disinfect objects and surfaces, especially the ones you touch regularly. You can use diluted bleach or alcohol for that. Make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.<EOS>#covid19 #awareness #covid19awareness #stayhome #staysafe https://t.co/DhmLIekRwi<EOS>	nonrumour

@hshaban @loisbeckett Is COVID-19 airborne?

WHAT IS COVID-19? The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome.  WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19?  Cough or Sneeze Shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing  Fever  Muscle pain	HOW IS COVID-19 SPREAD? Droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes  There are two routes by which people could become infected: Secretions can be directly transferred into the mouths or noses of people who are nearby (within 2 metres)<EOS>or could be inhaled into the lungs  It is also possible that someone may become infected by touching a surface or object that has been contaminated with respiratory secretions (such as touching a doorknob or shaking hands with an infected) and then touching their own mouth, nose.<EOS>HOW CAN YOU PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19?  Wash your hands frequently with soap under running water or use alcohol-based sanitizer if water is not available.  Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing.<EOS>	nonrumour

Remember:   Seasonal flu is *very different* to pandemic flu.  If someone says "Covid-19 is just like the flu", check which one they're talking about.  If they mean "seasonal flu", take what they say with a bucketload of salt.	1918 Spanish flu: One of the worst pandemics in history, killed up to 50 million people  1957 Asian flu: Killed at least a million  1968 Hong Kong flu: Killed at least a million  1977 Russian flu: Less than a million deaths  2009 swine flu: Killed several hundred thousand<EOS>One of those five pandemics, the Russian flu, appears to have been just an old defrosted flu strain from a laboratory. People alive in the 1950s were immune, and the virus was weirdly similar to earlier ones. So really we're down to four truly novel pandemics.<EOS>Anyone reading this has almost certainly lived through a pandemic, the H1N1 swine flu in 2009, but we were lucky there that it was extremely mild with a fatality rate not much different to seasonal flu.<EOS>Fatality rates often fall as an epidemic spreads but it would be unwise to assume that case fatality in every pandemic will fall to swine flu levels. All the evidence so far suggests Covid-19 mortality is higher, by at least an order of magnitude.  https://t.co/Pthp3Dwafs<EOS>So don't panic but please don't be complacent.  Lots of tech/finance types are still talking about this as if it's no big deal.  Virologists and epidemiologists are taking it far more seriously.  https://t.co/DK3joYkZwE<EOS>@davidfickling Hoy did all those pandemic go away?<EOS>@gustavobeltran Herd immunity gradually built up to the point it wasn't able to spread easily, and under this selective pressure the virus evolved to different and less fatal strains<EOS>As the name implies, seasonal flu goes round the world every year. We have high rates of immunity to it because many of us have been exposed before, and we even have vaccines to prevent it.  Pandemic flu happens just a few times in every century and is much more alarming.<EOS>@davidfickling D<EOS>	rumour

Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics shud not be used as a means of prevention/treatment.  #KHKTCoronaCampaign	According to WHO guidelines COVID-19 advice for public: Myth busters   COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot &amp; humid climates From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, incl. areas with hot &amp; humid weather.   #KHKTCoronaCampaign<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?

He is a sham and a douche... same as all of them.<EOS>@CNN Not what she is claiming<EOS>@C_keroftruth101 takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be<EOS>@CNN Kim Davis makes my skin crawl!<EOS>@CNN ask POTUS why does Chicago his home town has very strict gun laws &amp; very high gun violence? @GMA @MSNBC @CBSNews @NewDay @NBCNews<EOS>@hndavis12 @CNN 1 of the great things about this pope is he doesn't care about appearances. Maybe he was modeling peace &amp; forgiveness<EOS>@CNN thank GOD<EOS>@CNN Well, she's a very lucky person to have met him.<EOS>@CNN Of course it's a form of support! It just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies.  He supported the death row inmate too<EOS>@Lindzsy @CNN she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position. its a small town so go figure #KanyeShrug<EOS>@CNN hope he gave her a WTF about being divorced 3 times.<EOS>@CNN Many people "meet" with a Pope. Apparently this was a blessing in DC. He probably never heard of her then Wham! He's in a storm.<EOS>@CNN all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth<EOS>@CNN @TheDeemeister too late! What other reason would the Pope have for a private meeting (she's not even Catholic)<EOS>@CNN The face of mental illness being made famous.<EOS>@CNN @CodyDorumsgaard ((saw your status on Facebook the other day))<EOS>@CNN  yes just like people do for imagrents.<EOS>@CNN then what should it be considered? Unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. #getreal<EOS>@CNN A church desperate to look cool is a sad thing<EOS>@CNN She just needs to go away<EOS>@CNN #KimDavis should have kept this meeting private bet that's what Pope wanted shes using it to glorify/publicize herself more #Shameless<EOS>@CNN The Vatican is has given in. SMH. #KimDavis has More guts and stronger in her faith Than the Vatican and it Pope.<EOS>@CNN #PopeFrancis is a bullshitter<EOS>@CNN What is it then? Does Catholic church support homosexuality? Does it conduct gay marriages?<EOS>@CNN So what was it then? Trying to help the sinner stop homophobing? A strategy session? Swapping culture war stories? An affair?<EOS>@CNN don't tell me that the Vatican us telling a lie<EOS>@CNN it's definitely support. But the Pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse. So who really cares.<EOS>@CNN Then exactly how should the meeting be considered? @Pontifex shouldn't have met with #KimDavis to begin with. Rewarded bad behavior.<EOS>@CNN @BjdelongBj.  Nor forgiveness...<EOS>@CNN So what is it?

Ms. Davis has a true commitment to God and His Word. The Pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and $$.<EOS>@CNN Too late for this...<EOS>@CNN  I stand with you Kim..God be with you.<EOS>@CNN ~ did he spank her ?<EOS>@CNN so if all the military and police who protected him on his US  visit refused to do their job  based on religious beliefs is that ok?<EOS>@CNN you support or you don't, sorry, too many on the fence, it broke.<EOS>With how many of God's gay children did @Pontifex meet? In secret or public? Whether supportive or not? @CNN<EOS>@CNN the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind, find a solution to Oregon like issues<EOS>@CNN important point is that he met with her and not gay groups. Gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage.<EOS>@CNN 😒<EOS>@CNN @Pontifex so I assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage?<EOS>@CNN Millions of Catholics wait a Lifetime to share a moment with a Pope.Why Her?Because the Pope is a Socialist who knows Propaganda!<EOS>@CNN @DevinGoldenberg Maybe not but the Pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from France to the Vatican.Says much<EOS>@CNN popeturd is back tracking already... The PC police flexing their muscle again... Disgusting; and people still worship this false idol.<EOS>@CNN @LisaToddSutton Why would he meet with her anyway? You lost me, off my list!<EOS>@CNN Simply stop talking about her<EOS>@CNN Funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be...<EOS>@iShakeTheThrone @Pontifex @CNN he met with a gay couple the day before Kim Davis<EOS>@CNN then he shouldn't have met with her!!<EOS>@CNN Doesn't matter why or what was said. She will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia. Just like they do with abortion issue<EOS>@CNN no it should not!<EOS>@CNN The Vatican is hedging its bets in case she goes full psycho. (She's halfway there.)<EOS>@CNN Pope met w/her in support of her religious liberty &amp; conscience to put God's law above constitution, which he made clear his position.<EOS>@CNN He too (#Pope) will stand before God. But won't be left standing. Repent of thy ways &amp; turn to God &amp; His Ways. #KimDavis -be encouraged<EOS>@CNN That is a lie and the Vatican didn't say that. Homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians. #kimdavis<EOS>@CNN Pope Francis may have spoke against Jesus Christ but he is not stupid enough to take a STAND on NONSENSE by the Kentucky Clerk<EOS>@CNN then how should we consider it? A show of...???<EOS>@CNN 1)Kim Davies is1 of d most courageous human I know.ALONE,she stood PUBLICALLY to defend God's guide for Mankind's progress&amp;evolution.<EOS>@CNN that's right people! Somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging! That's a sin! #crazylady<EOS>@CNN @Clarknt67 Read the rest of the sentence, not support for ALL of what she is doing. They qualified it. Meaning they support some of it<EOS>@Badass_Abe @CNN He is a holy man giving comfort.<EOS>@CNN I bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do I really have to talk to her<EOS>@SCritique @CNN the people standing against gay marriage are the minority.  46% is not a silent majority.  Less god, more math.<EOS>@CNN but what I heard on news..it seems it was a form of support..it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b.s<EOS>@Badass_Abe @CNN exactly.

First, how does #COVID_19 spread? 1. The virus can spread to people who are within about 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 when that person coughs or sneezes. 2. The virus can spread through direct contact with their saliva or mucus	Tips for sex during COVID # 3: Time to cut out casual hookups. Sexing folks you don't know very well can be super risky at this point because The ‘Rona spreads real easy. (Block that homie who stay sliding into the DMs, issa no for low key low down loving). https://t.co/bpn79c4s84<EOS>Tips for sex during COVID # 4: Contact is high risk give in-person dates a miss.

Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.	However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at d early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research<EOS>HOW LIKELY AM I TO CATCH THE COVID 19<EOS>The risk depends on where you  are - and more ,whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

@samwilkinson @stancija @kloss_tiffany @anarchomastia I'm fine with equal access to institutions. What is the use of this "institution?" Why do we need it?

The cheapest way to send a Birthday Card to a rural residence is $15.50:  $7.85 base charge for a Ground 1lb. pkg going &lt; 150 miles $4.00 residence charge  $3.65 rural charge  Charge for same service by USPS?   $0.50 or 31 times cheaper   Save the USPS<EOS>@kloss_tiffany @samwilkinson @lildipshit3 @anarchomastia Explain the justice of city folks subsidizing rural folks.

Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.	Q. What is a CoronaVirus? A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.  #coronavirus #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. What is COVID-19? A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>Q. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? A. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirus<EOS>Q. How fatal is COVID-19? A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. How does COVID-19 spreads? A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates<EOS>[2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #CoronaAlert #coronavirus<EOS>[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia<EOS>Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia<EOS>[2/2] It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #Corona #coronavirusindia<EOS>	nonrumour
Q. How likely am I to catch COVID-19? A. The risk depends on where you live or where you have travelled recently. The risk of infection is higher in areas where a number people have been diagnosed with COVID-19. #coronavirusindia	Q. Should I worry about COVID-19? A.[1/3] If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low.<EOS>[2/3] Look out information from your national public health authority for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether it is in your area.  It is important to be informed of the situation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself.<EOS>[3/3] If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice issued by national and local health authorities.  #CoronaVirusUpdates #coronavirusindia #CoronavirusReachesDelhi<EOS>	nonrumour

@maryjanecrisp @DrDenaGrayson @fmbutt '...the World Health Organization insists “the new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.”  “To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,” the WHO reports.' https://t.co/d7qpuQCzcC	@DrDenaGrayson This would make grocery shopping a pretty serious issue.

The question I have is why COVID-19 is less transmissible than Measles if it is actually an airborne transmitted disease?<EOS>@fmbutt The size of respiratory particles for #coronavirus is thought to be larger than for measles, so it was thought to spread less readily.

The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites. To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.	The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. https://t.co/e9aXGZ5CPH<EOS>To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing. https://t.co/kSdfGWv5GI<EOS>Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus? No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<EOS>Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. https://t.co/sJhxDjdhrA<EOS>Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus? UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation. https://t.co/2pmp1tHJwG<EOS>How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus? Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. https://t.co/KnrTczQAWn<EOS>Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus? No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.<EOS>Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. https://t.co/wd5VHaUFan<EOS>Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus? No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.<EOS>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.<EOS>Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health. https://t.co/Qu00YqTLMP<EOS>Can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. https://t.co/U63r6XI6p6<EOS>Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/yaLUTNsWGV<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/bThbxOL21K<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/WpTNgsfJMU<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus? To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.<EOS>Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

They'll say the millions of deaths were from other vaccines, or bad Chinese food habits. They'll say Big Pharma created this whole mess to make money. They'll repeat history again and again. 2/2<EOS>#FlattenTheCurve #coronavirus #COVID19 #VaccinesWork<EOS>	rumour

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan	Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.  #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.  #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.     #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?” #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. #LetsFightCorona @MenPk1 @TeamForPakistan<EOS>	nonrumour

@BuckSexton Where are the scientists and doctors to set the story straight. Of course absolute numbers are going up as testing increases. And that’s helping herd immunity. What is most important though is cases requiring vents and fatalities, this is going down. WTF???

How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. (1/3) https://t.co/rJzAEDFcVR	These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. (2/3)<EOS>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. (3/3)  e: covid19@ukzn.ac.za t: 0800 029 999  #ukzncovid19<EOS>	nonrumour
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?	What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. https://t.co/LM6wHFpLd9<EOS>Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.<EOS>This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<EOS>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.<EOS>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why?<EOS>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why?<EOS>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why?<EOS>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.<EOS>Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.<EOS>This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++<EOS>diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

4. COVID-19 is just like the flu SARS-CoV-2 definitely has flu like symptoms- aches, fever, and cough. both COVID-19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia. However, COVID-19 is more dangerous with  with a mortality rate between 1% and 3%,10-50 times greater than the seasonal flu	2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.<EOS>5. Everyone with COVID-19 dies This statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. In fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization<EOS>6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus  https://t.co/speJA9BUHu<EOS>7. Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter. https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa<EOS>8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself<EOS>9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.<EOS>9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.<EOS>10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.<EOS>14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.<EOS>15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.  So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray.

Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.<EOS>You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching covid-19 DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.  Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.<EOS>Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort DOES NOT mean you are free from the COVID-19 or any other lung disease.  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Take an official test to confirm.<EOS>COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates  From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials<EOS>Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.  There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.<EOS>Taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your body temperature is 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you<EOS>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.  To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.

@bydelight @TrU3Ta1ent In other words, devs have the knowledge they need to make changes therefore why do we need it? To make a fuss about it? Killers already send hateful messages (including death threats even!) to survivors they SUSPECT to be swf, the community cant handle that info in short.	I was asked today to do this so I'll just make a poll. Would you guys like a UI added for end game score screen which shows if you were against a SWF? Be it a 2 man, 2, 2 man, 3 man or a 4 man? I feel this would give us more data and less speculation and patterns could form.<EOS>@TrU3Ta1ent realistically, what will it prove? sure, you can gain data on swf matches versus solo but you will never know which matches those are until theyre over so would it really matter? what knowledge would be gained that isnt already known? and what would be gained from said knowledge?<EOS>@MudbloodWolfie Every match with 4 man swf has a high probability of x. Every match with double swf has x probability...etc<EOS>@TrU3Ta1ent i understand that but you dont know if it's swf before a match so said knowledge wouldnt make a difference within it. beforehand, it would just be speculation therefore how would it be useful? you'd still be playing a match and getting data as you play. 1/2<EOS>@TrU3Ta1ent 2/2 is said data to be used to nerf swf somehow? to prove what we already know, swf is powerful? to cast blame on a loss from? because that is how people would abuse this information. not to mention the additional abuse players would get for playing swf.<EOS>@MudbloodWolfie @TrU3Ta1ent Hey 😁  Devs have all the data they want. Showing some extra intel to killers would suddenly decide them to act on SWF ?  Also, I do not get how this data could be abused ?<EOS>@MudbloodWolfie @bydelight @TrU3Ta1ent Simply put, it gives the killer peace of mind knowing that they lost due to something out of their control.<EOS>@Brisingr7337 @bydelight @TrU3Ta1ent It would, yes. But you have to consider the community as a whole. People get death threats for simply playing well. Some people just cant handle that kind of information. If they find theyre only playing swf and losing, they wont play thus dropping sales. 1/2<EOS>	nonrumour

Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”	Part 5  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 10  Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However,  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 11  many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 12  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.     #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 13  Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 14   route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 15  Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 16  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 19  droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 20  surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<EOS>Part 22  cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 23  have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 24  Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 25  You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.  **********  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading  Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 26  everyone)  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 27  to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 28 Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 29  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?  The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around<EOS>Part 30  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to<EOS>Part 31  comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 32  China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

@BrobanGrian @M8mouse @nytimes Because coronavirus has something behind it. What good is Wuhan Virus? The virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China? What good does that do anyone? At least when someone asks 'what is a coronavirus?' some info can be given on that.	@nytimes This makes me so angry it is #COVID19  or #coronavirus it is not Wuhan Virus and the shit could be anywhere!<EOS>@BrobanGrian @M8mouse @nytimes Technically coronavirus is more correct given that it IS a type of coronavirus. Calling the Wuhan Virus is useless, uninformative and given the climate in the US just invites more trouble for Asian Americans.<EOS>@BrobanGrian @M8mouse @nytimes No, because it doesn't tell you anything about what it does to the body. There's a reason why the WHO put out guidelines for naming new viruses, although unfortunately the system is still not 100% on track.<EOS>@BrobanGrian @M8mouse @nytimes Which is due to ignorance or lack of knowledge, not the name itself. Spanish Flu, Wuhan virus, neither of these things tell you anything under examination.

Should I worry about COVID-19?   Although illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults.   It is still quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.	I've read a lot about Corona virus lately and I think I should share some highlights of the good read.  It's a #Thread, and in form of Q &amp; A.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.  The mask can only be used once. If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.<EOS>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.<EOS>Is there anything I should not do?   The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  1. Smoking  2. Taking traditional herbal remedies   3. Wearing multiple masks   4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.<EOS>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.  #CoronaAlert  #coronavirus  #CoronaOutbreak #Thread<EOS>	nonrumour

@Investacus @__sammy_r Från who: Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.

För jag hittar inte på WHOs hemsida<EOS>@Investacus @__sammy_r However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<EOS>@Investacus @__sammy_r WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people it can take even longer for symptoms to appear.  Symptoms can include:  ●Fever ●Cough ●Trouble breathing ●Feeling tired ●Muscle aches	Most people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death. This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.<EOS>Should I see a doctor or nurse?  If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call your doctor or nurse. You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days<EOS>●You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website: https://t.co/TZfMwQbXwt.<EOS>You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.<EOS>If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go. If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask.<EOS>The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people.<EOS>The staff might also have you wait some place away from other people.<EOS>If you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead. This way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.<EOS>Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. They will also ask questions about any recent travel and whether you have been around anyone who might be sick.<EOS>Will I need tests?  Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have COVID-19, they test samples of fluid taken from inside your nose and mouth. They might also do tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up, as well as your urine and stool (bowel movements).<EOS>Your doctor might also order a chest X-ray to check your lungs.<EOS>How is COVID-19 treated?  Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the "ICU").<EOS>There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions, and make you as comfortable as possible.<EOS>You might need extra oxygen to help you breathe easily. If you are having a very hard time breathing, you might need to be put on a ventilator. This is a machine to help you breathe.<EOS>Can COVID-19 be prevented?  There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19:  ●Wash your hands with soap and water often. ●Avoid touching your face with your hands. ●Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.<EOS>●Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19. Experts do not recommend wearing a face mask if you are not sick, unless you are caring for someone who has (or might have) COVID-19.<EOS>If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:  ●Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.<EOS>●Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person, you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room.<EOS>●Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear a disposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any body fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.<EOS>●Clean often – It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, and bathroom surfaces. ●Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water often<EOS>How can I prepare for a possible COVID-19 outbreak?  It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.<EOS>If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.<EOS>There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.<EOS>This way you will be able to receive and share information easily.<EOS>If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk, try not to panic.<EOS>Where can I go to learn more?  As we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. Check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself.<EOS>	nonrumour

Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.	Can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus? Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus. https://t.co/jqJLzLRaqX<EOS>Does putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body? No. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75%<EOS>ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform. However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. https://t.co/iwcpdnCcHT<EOS>Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to<EOS>be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.   WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. https://t.co/pmLJPjrF3f<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible. https://t.co/5hBww654bN<EOS>Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat<EOS>symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners. https://t.co/KlV6s5lbvH<EOS>@ItsNotPersonal0 Now looked at the marked area and read my tweet again. https://t.co/xbMYB0t4mA<EOS>	nonrumour

Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?   No.   The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different.   SARS is MORE DEADLY but much less infectious than COVID-19.	What is COVID-19?   COVID-19 is the INFECTIOUS disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.  This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<EOS>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?   No.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.   COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.<EOS>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?   Not yet.  To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.  However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.   People with serious illness should be hospitalized.<EOS>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?   Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.  The mask can only be used once. If you are not ill/looking after someone who is ill then you are WASTING a mask.<EOS>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?   No.   There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.<EOS>Is there anything I should not do?   The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:  1. Smoking  2. Taking traditional herbal remedies   3. Wearing multiple masks   4. Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.<EOS>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.  #CoronaAlert  #coronavirus  #CoronaOutbreak #Thread<EOS>	nonrumour

What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to	more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19<EOS>What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.<EOS>These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.<EOS>Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.<EOS>People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>How does COVID-19 spread? People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. T<EOS>These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets<EOS>from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.<EOS>	nonrumour

8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself	Thread about some popular myths on corona virus  1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin  These cannot kill viruses within the body!!<EOS>6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus  https://t.co/speJA9BUHu<EOS>7. Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter. https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa<EOS>9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.<EOS>9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.<EOS>10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.<EOS>14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.<EOS>15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.  So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray.

So what is Sweden pursuing, exactly? The strategy rests on a few pillars.  1) lockdowns are wrong  2) you are delaying deaths into the future  3) we are building herd immunity  4) we can spread the virus safely   Debunked, one by one	And that's why they have always been strong opponents of lockdowns: Tegnell repeatedly said there was no evidence they would work. I mean, what have the lockdowns ever done for us? https://t.co/MB1qf5eoQ3<EOS>And to be fair, in theory it would have been an interesting question to explore back in March: are we sure they help? But we did not have a EU-sized laboratory nor the time to get data in. We had to act first. All we had is a control group, Sweden, which did not do very well<EOS>1) As the BBC article demonstrates, lockdowns greatly reduced the number of new cases in many countries. They saved lives, they bought us time, they contained potential superspreader events, and more<EOS>2) If you read the news in Sweden, in March they kept repeating that all the countries that went into lockdown will face a tragic second wave, hence we were doing the right thing by carefully spreading the virus now. Let's put it that statement to test, shall we?<EOS>Denmark and Norway and Finland lifted their restrictions about the same days, let's use May 11th (DK and NO) as the ref. One month ago. How many more deaths have occurred in Scandinavia since our neighbors exited lockdowns?  SW  1493  DK      74  FI        57 NO     22 https://t.co/yV6lZe1WLA<EOS>3) But we are smart, we are building herd immunity!  [Side note: the argument is so morally repugnant I won't even begin to unpack it, as it reeks of social darwinism, but let's try and keep it aside, albeit difficult to keep aside. Anyhow let's go ahead]<EOS>Herd immunity my a$$. You should never allow a bunch of people who suck at math take a "calculated risk". It is spreading slower than much more painfully than thought before  https://t.co/OvxXq33jmZ<EOS>Coda: and it's not only the snapshot of today/ this week, it's the direction that is worrisome. Today Italy has found 202 new positive cases, Sweden (1/6th of the population) 776<EOS>Data as we stand today   New cases  🇮🇹 202  🇸🇪776   New deaths  🇮🇹 71  🇸🇪67  Currently in ICU  🇮🇹 249  🇸🇪283   Sweden has 1/6 of the population<EOS>However, direction is important too. Sweden is nowhere near limiting the spread (because, surprise, it has no intention to). *Partly* because we finally started testing more, but largely because we have a lot of infections, numbers are going up, not down https://t.co/KZH2Vcun3e<EOS>There is no bending the curve necessary in the fantasy land of the we-should-soon-become-immune people https://t.co/zX95Dp2gSf<EOS>Now, both countries have a large CFR -mortality for every 100 people found positive. And to Sweden's credit they have finally started testing more (bravo!) But it's still high at 10% https://t.co/L1qn7ZbetV<EOS>And our policy as it stands is *designed* to produce new infections in the range of 500-600 per day (even if you dismissed the lab in Stockholm as a statistical fluke). How come Swedes are accepting a magnitude of 20x the deaths of their nordic neighbors? Be still, my heart<EOS>	nonrumour

What is COVID-19?  COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019	@PhilipObin https://t.co/fpgXFqhcSF<EOS>	nonrumour

9. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?	CORONA VIRUS. Thread.<EOS>6. So, how does the disease spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.<EOS>7. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.<EOS>8. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.<EOS>10. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.<EOS>11. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<EOS>12.  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone!  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.<EOS>13. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.<EOS>13.(A) However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.  You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:<EOS>13.(B) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<EOS>13. (C) Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.<EOS>13. (C)...  If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.<EOS>	nonrumour

What are the symptoms of COVID-19? The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.	Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.<EOS>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.<EOS>	nonrumour

5. Everyone with COVID-19 dies This statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people. In fact 80% face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization	Thread about some popular myths on corona virus  1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin  These cannot kill viruses within the body!!<EOS>2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.<EOS>6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus  https://t.co/speJA9BUHu<EOS>7. Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter. https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa<EOS>8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself<EOS>9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.<EOS>9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.<EOS>10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.<EOS>14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.<EOS>15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.  So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray.

7. Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?  No. Vaccines against pneumonia offer no protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop one &amp; WHO is in support.	The #coronavirus threat is still out there and with it comes the possibility of some misconceptions, especially those fake WhatsApp broadcasts.  Here are some myths that have cropped up so far and facts by the @WHO to debunk them. https://t.co/uaDccxnsAZ<EOS>1. Is it safe to receive a letter or a package from China?  Yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.<EOS>3. How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection. However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.<EOS>4. Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?  UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.<EOS>5. Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?  No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap &amp; water.<EOS>6. Can pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?  At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap &amp; water after contact with pets.<EOS>8. Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?  People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus but older people &amp; those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, etc.) appear to be more vulnerable.<EOS>WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.<EOS>9. Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?  No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.  The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.<EOS>10. Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?  To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.  However, those infected with the virus are receiving appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.<EOS>	nonrumour
2. Only older adults and young people are at risk  COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.	#Coronavirus Myths You Mustn't believe RT to save someone   1. Hand dryers kill coronavirus  Hand dryers do not kill coronavirus. The best way to protect yourself and others from the virus is to wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.<EOS>3. Everyone with COVID-19 dies  COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.  In a recent report, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that 80.9% of COVID-19 cases were mild.  Need to talk to a Doctor &gt;&gt; https://t.co/a1LV9BtgBH<EOS>	rumour
@WHO Q : How likely am i to catch COVID-19?  A : The risk depends on where you live or where you have travelled recently. The risk of infection is higher in areas where a number people have been diagnosed with COVID-19.

so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.   🧪 *Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?*	WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR COVID-19 (INCLUDING DRUGS, VACCINES, THERAPIES)?  💊 *Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?* No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus,<EOS>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention<EOS>or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.  💉 *Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?*<EOS>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.<EOS>Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.<EOS>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.<EOS>#WHO#Whatsapp<EOS>	nonrumour

Part 6  How does COVID-19 spread?  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.   #FREDIBOAT	Part 5  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 7  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19<EOS>Part 8  who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.      #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 9 Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”<EOS>Part 5  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 10  Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However,  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 11  many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 12  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.     #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 13  Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 14   route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 15  Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 16  What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?  Protection measures for everyone  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 19  droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 20  surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 21 This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as<EOS>Part 22  cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 23  have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 24  Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why?  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 25  You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.  **********  Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading  Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 26  everyone)  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 27  to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why?

Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 29  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?  The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around<EOS>Part 30  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to<EOS>Part 31  comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 32  China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.  You can see these at https://t.co/IsbnwJ3QWg<EOS>Part 10  Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?  The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However,  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 11  many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.   #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 12  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.     #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 13  Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 14   route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 17  Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly #FREDIBOAT<EOS>for the latest news.  Part 18 You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with  #FREDIBOAT<EOS>Part 19  droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why?

3. Taking a hot bath doesn't prevent you from catching COVID-19.  4. The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.	Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new kind that was discovered in 2019 and hasn't been previously identified in humans. https://t.co/6BNvWJUpCQ<EOS>This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, and even death. https://t.co/52dGXGoGvX<EOS>5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Follow the directions of your local health authority.  6. Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. https://t.co/XJHiFN7AxB<EOS>Things that need more attention about COVID-19 :  1. COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates.  2. Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.<EOS>5. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.  6. UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.<EOS>7. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have fever because of the new coronavirus infection. But, cannot detect people who are infected without fever.  8. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body won't kill viruses that have already entered your body.<EOS>9. Vaccines against pneumonia, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.  10. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.<EOS>11. Garlic may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.  12. People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>13. Antibiotics don't work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and antibiotics shouldn't be used as a means of prevention or treatment.  14. There is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).<EOS>Thanks for your nice attention. Source : https://t.co/8fyXxPJ48i<EOS>	nonrumour

6. Cats and dogs spread coronavirus Currently, very little evidence. However, in Hong Kong, a Pomeranian whose owner had COVID-19 became infected. The dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus  https://t.co/speJA9BUHu	Thread about some popular myths on corona virus  1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body Applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm. Disinfect surfaces not skin  These cannot kill viruses within the body!!<EOS>2. Older people (&gt;60) and young (&lt;14) are at risk SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, ANYONE with preexisting health conditions, like cancer, diabetes, lung infections, immunodeficiency is likely to get affected.<EOS>7. Face masks protect against coronavirus Disposable face masks may not provide protection. Yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Thus viral particles can also enter. https://t.co/lLm6zXNowa<EOS>8. Hand dryers kill coronavirus Hand dryers DONT KILL. Only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself<EOS>9. SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold All Coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host, which can be humans/animals. Covid19 is thought to be passed from animals/poultry to humans.<EOS>9-2. Thus some infect humans and many infect animals too. The best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet. This suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth. SARS and MERS were also passed 4m animals to humans.<EOS>10. Antibiotics kill coronavirus Antibiotics only kill bacteria AND NOT  viruses.<EOS>14. Thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus Thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons COVID-19 symptoms only 2–10 days after infection, and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with.<EOS>15.  Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 As SARS-CoV-2 is different than other viruses, no existing vaccines protect against infection.  So please dont panic, follow the Govt rules of curfew/isolation &amp;eat healthy. Finally dont forget to pray.

Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible? People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

COVID-19 is caused by a virus,<EOS>so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.   🧪 *Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?*<EOS>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention<EOS>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.<EOS>Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.<EOS>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.<EOS>#WHO#Whatsapp<EOS>	nonrumour

Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  Evidenced by the surge here at home you can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have had numerous cases.	Just as fast as the virus has spread so has the misinformation surrounding COVID - 19 which can be equally as harmful. In this thread you’ll find many of the popular theories debunked as outlined by the @WHO .<EOS>5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID-19  Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.   COVID-19 is spread through respiratoatry droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks.<EOS>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites. To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.<EOS>Black People Can Get Corona.  Data on race and the virus is too limited to draw sweeping conclusions, but disparate rates of sickness and death have emerged in some places.  COVID - 19 is infecting and killing black people in the US at disproportionately high rates. @nytimes<EOS>	nonrumour
